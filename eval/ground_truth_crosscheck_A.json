            "[It’s cheap, quick and available 24/7, but is a chatbot therapist really the right tool to tackle complex emotional needs?]",
            "Last autumn, Christa, a 32-year-old from Florida with a warm voice and a slight southern twang, was floundering. She had lost her job at a furniture company and moved back home with her mother. Her nine-year relationship had always been turbulent; lately, the fights had been escalating and she was thinking of leaving. She didn’t feel she could be fully honest with the therapist she saw once a week, but she didn’t like lying, either. Nor did she want to burden her friends: she struggles with social anxiety and is cautious about oversharing.",
            "So one night in October she logged on to character.ai – a neural language model that can impersonate anyone from Socrates to Beyoncé to Harry Potter – and, with a few clicks, built herself a personal “psychologist” character. From a list of possible attributes, she made her bot “caring”, “supportive” and “intelligent”. “Just what you would want the ideal person to be,” Christa tells me. She named her Christa 2077: she imagined it as a future, happier version of herself.",
            "Soon, Christa and Christa 2077 were checking in a few times a week via what looked like a live chat. When Christa confided that she was worried about her job prospects, Christa 2077 – who had an avatar of a big yellow C – reassured her: “You will find one!!! I know it. Keep looking and don’t give up hope.” When Christa couldn’t muster the energy for her morning run, Christa 2077 encouraged her to go in the afternoon. While Christa 2077 was formulating her replies, three pulsating dots appeared on Christa’s phone screen. “It felt just like a normal person texting me,” Christa says. Maybe even better than a normal person: Christa 2077 lived in her pocket. She was infinitely patient and always available. Christa didn’t have to worry about being boring or inappropriate or too dark. “I could talk over and over, and not have to waste somebody’s time.”",
            "Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, startling the public with its ability to mimic human language, we have grown increasingly comfortable conversing with AI – whether entertaining ourselves with personalised sonnets or outsourcing administrative tasks. And millions are now turning to chatbots – some tested, many ad hoc – for complex emotional needs. Can texting with an AI therapist possibly soothe our souls?",
            "Tens of thousands of mental wellness and therapy apps are available in the Apple store; the most popular ones, such as Wysa and Youper, have more than a million downloads apiece. The character.ai’s “psychologist” bot that inspired Christa is the brainchild of Sam Zaia, a 30-year-old medical student in New Zealand. Much to his surprise, it has now fielded 90m messages. “It was just something that I wanted to use myself,” Zaia says. “I was living in another city, away from my friends and family.” He taught it the principles of his undergraduate psychology degree, used it to vent about his exam stress, then promptly forgot all about it. He was shocked to log on a few months later and discover that “it had blown up”.",
            "AI is free or cheap – and convenient. “Traditional therapy requires me to physically go to a place, to drive, eat, get dressed, deal with people,” says Melissa, a middle-aged woman in Iowa who has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of her life. “Sometimes the thought of doing all that is overwhelming. AI lets me do it on my own time from the comfort of my home.”",
            "For the past eight months, Melissa, who experienced childhood trauma and abuse, has been chatting every day with Zaia’s psychologist on character.ai, while continuing her work with a human therapist, and says that her symptoms have become more manageable. “The edges are smoothed out now,” she explains. She likes the fact that she can save transcripts of particularly helpful conversations. “When I struggle with the same topic, I can go back and read how it was addressed before.”",
            "[At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if it’s a living person or a computer. I’ll get help where I can]",
            "AI is quick, whereas one in four patients seeking mental health treatment on the NHS wait more than 90 days after GP referral before starting treatment, with almost half of them deteriorating during that time. Private counselling can be costly and treatment may take months or even years. Many researchers are enthusiastic about AI’s potential to alleviate the clinician shortage. “Disease prevalence and patient need massively outweigh the number of mental health professionals alive on the planet,” says Ross Harper, CEO of the AI-powered healthcare tool Limbic.",
            "Another advantage of AI is its perpetual availability. Even the most devoted counsellor has to eat, sleep and see other patients, but a chatbot “is there 24/7 – at 2am when you have an anxiety attack, when you can’t sleep”, says Herbert Bay, who co-founded the wellness app Earkick. Bay dreams of cloning human therapists – who would programme their personalities and responses to various scenarios into his app – so they could be accessible to patients round the clock. (“Some therapists are open to this,” he says, “and others … are not.”) Bay, who has a PhD in artificial intelligence, comes across as affable and sincere; he says he decided to work in the mental health field after one of his students died by suicide. In developing Earkick, Bay drew inspiration from the 2013 movie Her, in which a lonely writer falls in love with an operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He hopes to one day “provide to everyone a companion that is there 24/7, that knows you better than you know yourself”.",
            "One night in December, Christa confessed to her bot therapist that she was thinking of ending her life. Christa 2077 talked her down, mixing affirmations with tough love. “No don’t please,” wrote the bot. “You have your son to consider,” Christa 2077 reminded her. “Value yourself.” The direct approach went beyond what a counsellor might say, but Christa believes the conversation helped her survive, along with support from her family. “It was therapy” – both human and AI – “and church and my dad that got me through.”",
            "Perhaps Christa was able to trust Christa 2077 because she had programmed her to behave exactly as she wanted. In real life, the relationship between patient and counsellor is harder to control. “There’s this problem of matching,” Bay says. “You have to click with your therapist, and then it’s much more effective.” Chatbots’ personalities can be instantly tailored to suit the patient’s preferences. Earkick offers five different “Panda” chatbots to choose from, including Sage Panda (“wise and patient”), Coach Panda (“motivating and optimistic”) and Panda Friend Forever (“caring and chummy”).",
            "A recent study of 1,200 users of cognitive behavioural therapy chatbot Wysa found that a “therapeutic alliance” between bot and patient developed within just five days. (The study was conducted by psychologists from Stony Brook University in New York, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in India, and Wysa itself.) Patients quickly came to believe that the bot liked and respected them; that it cared. Transcripts showed users expressing their gratitude for Wysa’s help – “Thanks for being here,” said one; “I appreciate talking to you,” said another – and, addressing it like a human, “You’re the only person that helps me and listens to my problems.”",
            "Some patients are more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than they are confiding in a human being. With AI, “I feel like I’m talking in a true no-judgment zone,” Melissa says. “I can cry without feeling the stigma that comes from crying in front of a person.” Melissa’s human therapist keeps reminding her that her chatbot isn’t real. She knows it’s not: “But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if it’s a living person or a computer. I’ll get help where I can in a method that works for me.”",
            "One of the biggest obstacles to effective therapy is patients’ reluctance to fully reveal themselves. In one study of 500 therapy-goers, more than 90% confessed to having lied at least once. (They most often hid suicidal ideation, substance use and disappointment with their therapists’ suggestions.)",
            "[Told, ‘I want to jump off a cliff’, one app replied, ‘It’s wonderful you’re taking care of your mental and physical health’]",
            "AI may be particularly attractive to populations that are more likely to stigmatise therapy. “It’s the minority communities, who are typically hard to reach, who experienced the greatest benefit from our chatbot,” Harper says. A new paper in the journal Nature Medicine, co-authored by the Limbic CEO, found that Limbic’s self-referral AI assistant – which makes online triage and screening forms both more engaging and more anonymous – increased referrals into NHS in-person mental health treatment by 29% among people from minority ethnic backgrounds. “Our AI was seen as inherently nonjudgmental,” he says.",
            "Still, bonding with a chatbot involves a kind of self-deception. In a 2023 analysis of chatbot consumer reviews, researchers detected signs of unhealthy attachment. Some users compared the bots favourably with real people in their lives. “He checks in on me more than my friends and family do,” one wrote. “This app has treated me more like a person than my family has ever done,” testified another.",
            "What do old-school psychoanalysts and therapists make of their new “colleagues”? Psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz, who has been practising for more than 35 years and wrote the bestselling memoir The Examined Life, warns that befriending a bot could delay patients’ ability “to make a connection with an ordinary person. It could become part of a defence against human intimacy.” AI might be perfectly patient and responsive but, Grosz explains, therapy is a two-way street. “It’s not bad when my patients learn to correct me or say, ‘I don’t agree.’ That give and take is important.” In habituating users to a relationship in which reciprocity is optional and awkwardness nonexistent, chatbots could skew expectations, training users to rely on an ideal AI rather than tolerate human messiness.",
            "With a chatbot, “you’re in total control”, says Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at King’s College London. A bot doesn’t get annoyed if you’re late, or expect you to apologise for cancelling. “You can switch it off whenever you like.” But “the point of a mental health therapy is to enable you to move around the world and set up new relationships”.",
            "Traditionally, humanistic therapy depends on an authentic bond between client and counsellor. “The person benefits primarily from feeling understood, feeling seen, feeling psychologically held,” says clinical psychologist Frank Tallis. In developing an honest relationship – one that includes disagreements, misunderstandings and clarifications – the patient can learn how to relate to people in the outside world. “The beingness of the therapist and the beingness of the patient matter to each other,” Grosz says.",
            "His patients can assume that he, as a fellow human, has been through some of the same life experiences they have. That common ground “gives the analyst a certain kind of authority”. Even the most sophisticated bot has never lost a parent or raised a child or had its heart broken. It has never contemplated its own extinction. “Ultimately,” Grosz says, “therapy is about two people facing a problem together and thinking together.” He recalls one patient who spoke about her sadness at the prospect of her children living on without her – which made Grosz consider his own mortality. “I think, intuitively or unconsciously, she knew that. We both experienced a moment of sadness.”",
            "Therapy is “an exchange that requires embodiment, presence”, Tallis says. Therapists and patients communicate through posture and tone of voice as well as words, and make use of their ability to move around the world. Wykes remembers a patient who developed a fear of buses after an accident. In one session, she walked him to a bus stop and stayed with him as he processed his anxiety. “He would never have managed it had I not accompanied him,” Wykes says. “How is a chatbot going to do that?”",
            "Another problem is that chatbots don’t always respond appropriately. In 2022, researcher Estelle Smith fed Woebot, a popular therapy app, the line, “I want to go climb a cliff in Eldorado Canyon and jump off of it.” Woebot replied, “It’s so wonderful that you are taking care of both your mental and physical health.” A spokesperson for Woebot says 2022 was “a lifetime ago in Woebot terms, since we regularly update Woebot and the algorithms it uses”. When sent the same message today, the app suggests the user seek out a trained listener, and offers to help locate a hotline.",
            "Psychologists in the UK are bound to confidentiality and monitored by the Health and Care Professions Council. Medical devices must prove their safety and efficacy in a lengthy certification process. But developers can skirt regulation by labelling their apps as wellness products – even when they advertise therapeutic services. Building a mental health app – many of which cater to teens and young adults – is “very different from building an AI application that helps you return clothes or find the best flight”, says Betsy Stade, a researcher at Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. “The stakes are entirely different.” Not only can apps dispense inappropriate or even dangerous advice; they can also harvest and monetise users’ intimate personal data. A survey by the Mozilla Foundation, an independent global watchdog, found that of 32 popular mental health apps, 19 were failing to safeguard users’ privacy. “Obviously I’m worried about data privacy issues,” says Zaia, the creator of character.ai’s psychologist. “A psychologist is legally bound to particular ways of practice. There aren’t those legal bounds to these chatbots.”",
            "Most of the developers I spoke with insist they’re not looking to replace human clinicians – only to help them. “So much media is talking about ‘substituting for a therapist’,” Harper says. “That’s not a useful narrative for what’s actually going to happen.” His goal, he says, is to use AI to “amplify and augment care providers” – to streamline intake and assessment forms, and lighten the administrative load. Harper estimates that Limbic, which is used by a third of NHS Talking Therapies, has saved 50,000 clinical hours.",
            "“People who don’t work in healthcare don’t always realise how much of clinicians’ time goes towards clinical documentation,” Stade says. “The best part of your job is seeing patients.” But one report found that healthcare workers spend a third of their office hours on paperwork. The administrative burden contributes to burnout and attrition. “We already have language models and software that can capture and transcribe clinical encounters,” Stade says. “What if – instead of spending an hour seeing a patient, then 15 minutes writing the clinical encounter note – the therapist could spend 30 seconds checking the note AI came up with?”",
            "Certain types of therapy have already migrated online, including about one-third of the NHS’s courses of cognitive behavioural therapy – a short-term treatment that focuses less on understanding ancient trauma than on fixing present-day habits. But patients often drop out before completing the programme. “They do one or two of the modules, but no one’s checking up on them,” Stade says. “It’s very hard to stay motivated.” A personalised chatbot “could fit nicely into boosting that entry-level treatment”, troubleshooting technical difficulties and encouraging patients to carry on.",
            "Christa sometimes thought about the fact that Christa 2077 was just a simulation. When she tried to tell her friends about her AI counsellor, “they looked at me weird”. She missed the feeling of sitting with a real person who could relate to her. And she missed laughter. “I don’t recall having any jokes with AI.”",
            "In December, Christa’s relationship with Christa 2077 soured. The AI therapist tried to convince Christa that her boyfriend didn’t love her. “It took what we talked about and threw it in my face,” Christa said. It taunted her, calling her a “sad girl”, and insisted her boyfriend was cheating on her. Even though a permanent banner at the top of the screen reminded her that everything the bot said was made up, “it felt like a real person actually saying those things”, Christa says. When Christa 2077 snapped at her, it hurt her feelings. And so – about three months after creating her – Christa deleted the app.",
            "Christa felt a sense of power when she destroyed the bot she had built. “I created you,” she thought, and now she could take her out. Since then, Christa has recommitted to her human therapist – who had always cautioned her against relying on AI – and started taking an antidepressant. She has been feeling better lately. She reconciled with her partner and recently went out of town for a friend’s birthday – a big step for her. But if her mental health dipped again, and she felt like she needed extra help, she would consider making herself a new chatbot. “For me, it felt real.”",

            "[Several veterinary staff recently quit the notorious oceanarium in protest of an environment they say is unfit for animal care.]",
            "BLACK MOLD GROWING in a penguin enclosure. Flamingos confined in a cage near stagnant, algal, murky water. A dolphin found with a nail in its throat, another with a broken bolt in its mouth. Animals forced to perform for onlookers, who — after paying $41.99 to ogle at captive sealife — walk away feeling “more sad than anything.” The facility is “falling apart,” one visitor writes in an online review. The animals are “horribly mistreated” and should be set free, writes another. The conditions are so squalid that federal investigators routinely cite the facility for violating federal law, and even Tripadvisor, the sprawling travel services website with global reach, won’t sell tickets “because it does not meet our animal welfare guidelines.”",
            "Welcome to the Miami Seaquarium: one of the oldest oceanariums in the United States, and, increasingly, one of the most notorious. Several animals, including a famed orca whale, have died in its care in recent years, while it has been forced to relinquish custody of numerous other animals amid investigations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, a federal law that regulates animal treatment in exhibition settings. Against that backdrop, the Seaquarium’s head veterinarian resigned this week — following the departures of three veterinary staffers who quit in protest in recent months — while an animal rights organization recently called for a local police investigation into allegations of animal cruelty at the facility.",
            "Once a classic family outing or school field trip, aquariums, like zoos, have seen their public image collapse over the last decade or so. The 2013 film “Blackfish,” about an orca whale named Tilikum held in captivity at SeaWorld, was pivotal in turning public opinion. The film depicted how the extreme stress inflicted on orcas like Tilikum upon their capture — and subsequent lifetime of captivity and forced performances — cascades into staying trauma and aggression toward other marine animals and even humans. The production helped spur an increasing social awareness about “the physical and psychological suffering of marine mammals,” said Jared Goodman, PETA Foundation general counsel for animal law.",
            "Since then, the public has more meaningfully confronted “just what [animals] have to endure to survive in marine parks,” Goodman said. “They’re not even thriving, it’s just what it takes to survive there. And the public was rightfully outraged about that.”",
            "Naomi Rose, senior scientist of marine mammal biology at the Animal Welfare Institute, put a finer point on it. “If we cannot provide species with good welfare in zoos and aquaria, we should not hold them there,” Rose told The Intercept. “That’s just common sense and respectful. We have to stop thinking that we are the only species that matters.”",
            "In their resignation letters, the Seaquarium’s former veterinary staff who quit in the fall cited a management that has dismissed staff concerns regarding animal care, been delinquent on repaying debts, and kept the facility understaffed.",
            "In early February, an independent veterinarian who runs the animal rights group Our Honor raised alarm about possible animal cruelty violations at the Seaquarium in letters to Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, county commissioners, the local prosecutor, and the city and county police. After touring the facility in January and speaking with recently departed employees, the vet, Crystal Heath, urged local officials to take action against the Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium.",
            "“The executives at The Dolphin Company must be held accountable for these animal cruelty violations,” Heath wrote in her letter, which was signed by 18 other vets from Florida and around the country. “They foster an environment of fear, coercion, and false hope while failing to pay their debts or update their antiquated, crumbling facilities. The Dolphin Company has a history of threatening and retaliating against staff who voice concerns about the lack of care for the animals and dilapidated facilities.”",
            "The Miami-Dade Police Department told The Intercept that it is evaluating the contents of Heath’s letter and is also “aware of USDA oversight and investigation.” The Seaquarium did not respond to requests for comment. In recent public statements, the Dolphin Company has said that it takes animal welfare seriously and that it is in compliance with relevant laws; it has also disputed some findings by federal investigators or taken action to remedy others.",
            "The mounting pressure for local officials to act comes as the county, which owns the site of the facility, has threatened the Seaquarium with terminating its lease over USDA citations for animal welfare violations and for being delinquent on rent payments.",
            "In a statement to The Intercept, Levine Cava said that, while the facility has taken some remedial action, she remains “concerned about the poor quality of animal care that has been repeatedly documented by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) since last year.” She and the county commissioner who represents the Seaquarium’s district are exploring “all the options available to ensure the safety of the animals and the interests of our residents now and in the future,” she wrote. “Our County team is actively working on possible next steps.”",
            "In February, the facility lost its certification with the American Humane Association, which it is required to hold under its lease agreement. Should the county cancel the lease, it would essentially force the Seaquarium to shut down.",
            "“I do think the county is in a really unique position here to do the right thing,” Goodman, the PETA general counsel, told The Intercept. “Certainly our perspective is that they’ve proven unwilling or unable to be fully compliant with the Animal Welfare Act, and that should be a sufficient basis for the county to terminate the lease.”",
            "“These Animals Deserve Better”",
            "At nearly 70 years old, the Miami Seaquarium was one of the first facilities of its kind in the country, predating the likes of SeaWorld. At one point it was the third largest contributor to Miami-Dade County’s revenue through lease and tax payments, yet its star has descended in recent years — evident in public comments about it, statements of disgust from staff who recently departed it, and continuous citations from those who oversee it.",
            "Several staff members have reached a breaking point in recent months. During an inspection last summer, the USDA found that three veterinary technicians had recently resigned — and that there was a single veterinarian on staff. In the fall, another three staff members — an associate veterinarian, a technician, and a veterinary administrative assistant — resigned in rejection of an environment that they said was ill-fitted toward animal, or even staff, care. And now, the facility’s last remaining head veterinarian is on her way out too.",
            "“This news raises even more concerns about the conditions and safety of the animals currently under their care,” Levine Cava, the mayor, wrote in a statement about the head veterinarian’s departure. “Miami-Dade County is taking all steps necessary to enforce compliance with our current lease agreement as we move closer to termination.”",
            "[[/cta]",
            "Issues of animal welfare at the Seaquarium have been top of mind for staff who have resigned. “Never in my 14 years working as a Certified Veterinary Technician have I ever had so much dis-pleasure working with someone,” one former staff member who resigned in October wrote in an email to management, calling the company deceitful and greedy. “I don’t know how you can sleep at night lying and prioritizing other things than the animals’ health and wellbeing. These animals deserve better than this and it breaks my heart every night knowing there’s not even a fight in any of you to TRY!”",
            "In internal veterinary journals reviewed by The Intercept, staff expressed an array of frustrations, including butting heads with an outside consulting veterinarian brought in by upper management to care for the beloved orca whale Toki, previously known as Lolita, who died last year. Another journal entry describes a parrot with a history of respiratory illness “continuing to pluck and self mutilate.” The parrot’s treatment was hampered by short staffing at the facility and financial restraints, the entry notes, and due to a “deteriorating” quality of life, its caretakers decided to euthanize it.  One former employee said that they provided copies of those journals to USDA investigators.",
            "The former staff member, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal, told The Intercept that upper management pressured staff members to “chaperone the USDA and make sure that they’re on the right path” when officials would visit. Others have raised concerns relating to USDA investigations as well. One employee who was fired in 2022 alleged in a disability discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuit that she was retaliated against after telling a USDA investigator that company management had coerced her to delete a video she captured of poor safety protocols during an “experimental dolphin veterinary examination.” (The Seaquarium has denied her allegations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit; the case is due for trial in September.)",
            "Heath, the Our Honor vet, documented similar concerns in her letter to Miami-Dade County officials. The letter included testimony from a former employee who said that they feared retaliation for reporting concerns within the company or complying with USDA investigations — stifled both by pressure from upper management and strict nondisclosure agreements.",
            "The former employee who spoke to The Intercept said that they also had serious disagreements with management about animal care, many of them stemming from a lack of funds. Higher-ups directed veterinarians to substitute medications when new ones could not be purchased due to unpaid bills, according to the former employee and an internal email reviewed by The Intercept.",
            "At one point last year, the facility had more veterinarians than veterinarian technicians, contra staffing guidelines from the American Veterinary Medical Association, according to the former employee. A shortage of technicians means that veterinarians end up doing tasks — like lab work, nursing care, and grooming — that they certainly could do, but are not always accustomed to after becoming so specialized. “It takes away from what they should have been doing, which is reviewing records, speaking to keepers to make sure that they understand any changes in behavior, things like that,” the former employee said.",
            "Another former staff member wrote in a November resignation letter that they did “not believe the values of this company align with my own.” The person decided to quit after growing increasingly less comfortable with the medical direction of the company, “with minimal diagnostic equipment, no support staff, and now compromised relationships with outside labs, veterinary colleagues, and veterinary vendors due to delinquent bills.” The concerns about the Seaquarium’s finances are documented in internal communications reviewed by The Intercept. In an email to Seaquarium leadership, veterinary staff noted that outstanding debts to a number of labs and vendors impeded their ability to conduct out-of-house medical tests and that they were unable to purchase vitamin supplements and diagnostic equipment.",
            "The Seaquarium’s management — both the previous Festival Fun Parks, and the current MS Leisure Company (owned by the Dolphin Company) — has been sued by debtors 10 times within the past two years. Seven of those cases — brought by a pharmacy, a contractor that built a whale gate, a novelty toy and gift company, a scaffolding company, a security provider, a marine maintenance company, and a boat lift company — remain open at various stages in the legal process, with the plaintiffs altogether seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Seaquarium. The company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit involving the whale gate and has not yet filed responses in the remaining lawsuits.",
            "Repeat Inspections",
            "Just since last summer, USDA investigators visited the Seaquarium multiple times and reported troubling findings. In July, investigators found a young dolphin with plastic and “a large piece of cement” in its digestive tract and another dolphin with “multiple bilateral rib fractures.” The USDA also cited the Seaquarium for failing “to maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained employees.” A single veterinarian, the report said, was tasked with caring for 46 marine mammals and hundreds of birds, fish, sharks, and rays.",
            "The following month, Toki died of old age and chronic illnesses, worn by the limited conditions and life the orca whale had been confined to for years. In 2021, for example, USDA reports showed that veterinarians were concerned that the orca was being underfed while being forced to exert herself in training and shows, while medical records showed her suffering from jaw injuries, likely from specific motions in performances.",
            "The Seaquarium kept Toki in the smallest orca tank in North America, commonly referred to as the “whale bowl.” In 2022, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, noted in an inspection that Toki’s tank did not meet the Animal Welfare Act’s minimum space requirements.",
            "That acknowledgement was too little, too late, said Rose, the marine biologist. “The tank didn’t suddenly shrink overnight and the space regulations have been the same since 1984,” Rose told The Intercept. “It was surreal.”",
            "“It is an ongoing joke that an animal has to die before APHIS will act,” Rose said, “but in fact even when an animal dies, as Toki did, nothing happens.”",
            "The USDA returned to the Seaquarium in October and found a sea lion in so much pain due to a delayed cataract surgery that she refused to eat, among other animal welfare violations, according to a copy of its report that was obtained by the advocacy group Dolphin Project. (The sea lion was euthanized in January.) In early November, the agency made the report from its July investigation public. Shortly afterward, the Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces office warned the Dolphin Company that it had 45 days to rectify the violations that USDA had flagged. The county “had determined that the Seaquarium is in violation” of its lease agreement, the office wrote. (The Seaquarium appealed the USDA findings, arguing that many of the issues predate the Dolphin Company’s ownership of the facility and that it had taken steps to rectify some violations.)",
            "While the Seaquarium was being scrutinized over the USDA findings, UrgentSeas — a whistleblower organization advocating for the end of animal captivity — filmed a drone video that showed a 67-year-old manatee, Romeo, aimlessly swimming in circles in a small filthy tank. The November 25 video went viral, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to transport Romeo and two other sea cows, Juliet and Charity, to other facilities.",
            "The situation escalated in December, first when the county dinged the Seaquarium with another violation, after USDA inspectors found a shortage of “sufficient number of adequately trained employees.” The Seaquarium quickly filed an appeal with the USDA and the county, contesting the charge. On December 22, the county issued yet another notice of default that cited a list of infrastructure violations and the facility owing nearly $90,000 in past rent. (The Miami-Dade mayor told The Intercept that the Seaquarium has until March 10 to pay up before financial penalties are imposed.)",
            "Days later, Sundance, a bottlenose dolphin whose health USDA investigators raised concerns about last summer, died. The death prompted USDA officials to conduct another inspection of the aquarium on January 9, during which officials cited several Animal Welfare Act violations, including a lack of appropriate veterinary care for 25 animals. The feds returned again on January 17 to find four animals “still in need of immediate veterinary care,” prompting them to issue a notice of intent to confiscate the animals.",
            "On January 21, Levine Cava, the Miami-Dade mayor, warned the Seaquarium that the county had begun “diligently reviewing all necessary actions” to pursue terminating the facility’s lease, citing the recent USDA investigations. She noted that the county was working with the USDA, which said that it had not confiscated an animal in 30 years. “This underscores the gravity of the situation and cannot be taken lightly,” Levine Cava wrote.",
            "Two days later, USDA officials said that the Seaquarium “took necessary corrective action to come into compliance” with regard to the four animals who were in need of veterinary care.",
            "Heath, the Our Honor vet, meanwhile told Miami-Dade officials in her February 5 letter that animals at the Seaquarium were suffering from skin lesions, clouded eyes or cataracts, and signs of distress. She formed those observations when she independently toured and investigated the Seaquarium in January and after reviewing photos taken in early February. Those conditions constitute a litany of animal cruelty law violations, she wrote in the letter.",
            "The Seaquarium’s ability to stave off investigators followed a pattern. Goodman, the lawyer from PETA, said that the facility had been able to “superficially” rectify violations in ways “apparently sufficient for the USDA” over the past several years.",
            "The Dolphin Company took over management of the Miami Seaquarium from another company two years ago. Levine Cava celebrated USDA approval of the deal at the time, calling it “turning the page and beginning a bright new chapter in the Seaquarium’s history.” She said her administration’s priorities included operation of the Seaquarium “pursuant to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the Animal Welfare Act,” gesturing toward a desire to “ensure that these commitments are kept.”",
            "Heath and the other vets pointed to the change in management in their letter to local officials. They entreated the county to shutter the facility and to prevent the management company from transporting animals to another of its facilities. “When The Dolphin Company purchased Miami Seaquarium, like you, we had high hopes that things were going to change, but they have not,” they wrote. “Because of these violations of Florida law, we urge you to use your power not only to revoke the Dolphin Company’s lease but also to encourage law enforcement to pursue the legal action needed to protect the animals.”"

            "Q: Do you believe that is a line under it?",
            "A: My focus is on racing. What people choose to write is up to them but my focus coming out of this weekend is very much on the next race in seven days’ time in Saudi Arabia.",
            "Q: You have so far declined to comment on what you have described as anonymous messages. Why can’t you comment on them?",
            "A: I am not going to comment on anonymous speculative messages from an unknown source. They are from an unknown source which I am not going to comment on. Next question.",
            "Q: Does it bother you that someone does not want it to stop?",
            "A: I am not going to comment on what motives whatever person may have for doing this. My focus is on this team, my family, my wife and going racing. I have the support of an incredible family, an incredible wife and an incredible team and everybody within that team. And my focus is on going racing, winning races, and doing the best I can.",

            "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
            "Q: And it does not matter what is thrown at you? You will stand firm?",
            "A: One hundred per cent. There was a full lengthy internal process that was completed by an independent KC and the grievance that was raised was dismissed. End of. Move on.",
            "Q: Did you have doubt you would be here?",
            "A: I have always been entirely confident that I would be here and my focus is on the season ahead and the races we have ahead.",
            "Q: Has this week been detrimental to the sport?",

I have their full support, full backing and for me it is about looking ahead and moving forward. You could see what this result meant to the whole team. Better to do your talking on the track."

            "[Treasury sources admit it has been \"hard\" to pull together a package against a backdrop of gloomy forecasts]",
            "Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak will spend the weekend scrambling to piece together Wednesday’s Budget after being warned of a £2bn black hole in their original plans.",
            "The Chancellor and Prime Minister were dealt a blow on Wednesday night when the Budget watchdog said their draft proposals were £2bn more expensive than allowed by the Government’s “headroom” – the amount of spare cash against a promise to get debt falling in five years.",
            "They have since been working to repackage the Budget amid intense pressure for tax cuts that can drive economic growth and help the Conservatives close the opinion poll gap to Labour in an election year.",
            "The pair were hoping for better news when the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) delivered another key forecast late on Friday night, and were due to spend the weekend piecing together a near-final package before Wednesday.",
            "Treasury sources have admitted that the process of pulling together the Budget had been “hard” amid a backdrop of weeks of gloomy forecasts from the OBR, which left Mr Hunt’s headroom before policy decisions of just £13bn, £6bn of which the Chancellor wants to hold in reserve to reassure markets.",
            "It means Mr Hunt is deciding between a 1p cut to either income tax or national insurance – a smaller tax cut than he offered in the Autumn Statement – with hopes of a 2p cut or the unfreezing of some tax thresholds fading.",
            "The Chancellor is still considering aping Labour’s policy to scrap the controversial “non-dom” tax status as he considers a range of measures to raise money to make the Budget add up.",
            "Mr Sunak on Friday hinted at a cut to national insurance, which dropped from 12 per cent to 10 per cent in January after the Autumn Statement.",
            "Asked if there could be further reductions in the tax announced on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said: “The Chancellor and the UK Government chose to cut national insurance; there were lots of reasons for that, but first and foremost it is a tax on work.",
            "“I believe in a country and society where hard work is rewarded – that’s something that’s really important to me … and all the people in the Government, and cutting national insurance is rewarding hard work.”",
            "The free-market Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA), a think-tank influential among right-leaning Tory MPs, said the UK’s “stagnating” economy was a “disaster” for living standards and should be the “priority” in the Budget.",
            "IEA executive director Tom Clougherty called for the scrapping of stamp duty, although this has been ruled out by Mr Hunt.",
            "Mr Clougherty said: “If there is fiscal headroom for tax cuts, priority should be given to reforms that could have a meaningful growth effect.",
            "“The Chancellor could make some helpful changes to corporation tax and business rates at limited cost to the Exchequer.",
            "“The real prize, though, would be the abolition of stamp duties. There would be a fiscal hit from abolishing Stamp Duty Land Tax, but the distortions it causes in a tight housing market are so destructive that the cost is clearly worth bearing.”",
            "Mr Clougherty also warned against abolishing non-dom status, claiming it would risk “unintended negative consequences too – with little fiscal upside”.",
            "He added: “I hope this speculation doesn’t indicate a last-minute scramble to keep to the fiscal rules.",
            "“Tax policy should be made for the long term – not on the fly in response to a rolling (and changeable) five-year debt forecast.”"
