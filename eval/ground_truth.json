            "CLAIM: Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency called the U.S. Air Force an “enemy” of Israel in a post on X after an active-duty member of the military branch set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.",
            "AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The account that made the post is not affiliated with Mossad and has previously published erroneous claims about Israel. Mossad’s official X account, to which the agency’s website links, has not posted anything since September 2020.",
            "THE FACTS: After 25-year-old airman Aaron Bushnell self-immolated outside the Israeli Embassy, while declaring he “will not longer be complicit in genocide,” social media users alleged that Mossad had denigrated the U.S. Air Force on X in response.",
            "Many posts shared a screenshot of two posts from an account called “Mossad Commentary.” One includes an image of Bushnell on fire captioned with the widely-used expression, in Hebrew, “Am Yisrael chai,” meaning “the people of Israel live.” The second, made in response to the first, states: “Our enemies kill themselves.”",
            "The first post had been deleted by Monday afternoon, but an archived version shows that it was still up early in the morning. The second post remains live on the platform.",
            "“BREAKING: Mossad labels United States Air Force an ENEMY to the state of @Israel,” reads an X post from a different account that included the screenshot. It had received more than 10,600 likes and shares on Monday.",
            "But Mossad Commentary, which uses Mossad’s logo as its profile picture, is not affiliated with the Israeli intelligence agency and has previously made false claims about the Jewish state. For example, a post from October 2023 states that Yemen had “officially” declared war on Israel. The Associated Press reported at the time that Yemen’s internationally recognized government had done no such thing.",
            "Another post from the account called Bushnell “an idiot” after he set himself on fire.",
            "Mossad’s website links to its official X account, which is called in Hebrew “The Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks.” The most recent post is from September 2020.",
            "The Israeli military said Mossad Commentary is “clearly not an official account” in response to an email query from the AP. Mossad Commentary did not respond to a message from the AP on X.",
            "Bushnell died from his injuries. According to AP reporting, he had walked to the embassy shortly before 1 p.m. on Sunday and began livestreaming on Twitch, a video streaming platform. Law enforcement officials believe he set his phone down and then doused himself in accelerant and ignited the flames.",
            "Israel has adamantly denied genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in the Israel-Hamas war in accordance with international law.",

We’ll all miss her, as I know her family will.”",

            "The parade was intended to celebrate another milestone accomplishment for the Chiefs — becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl champions since New England in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Instead, it sent the Chiefs and their city into an offseason full of heavy hearts.",
            "“Before we get into the football topics, I’d like to definitely start off by offering our thoughts and prayers to Lisa Lopez-Galvan and her family, all the families that were impacted the day of the parade,” Veach said. “Certainly, a heartbreaking and tragic day for us. Our organization has been in contact with the families, and we will continue to do so and be a pillar of support for them both now and into the future.”",
            "Veach went on to thank the first responders who tended to the victims and helped bystanders navigate their way to safety.",

We can turn this, which was a negative, into a real positive. With just a little togetherness and love, we can fix a lot of problems.”",

            "Under the plan, member states would have to meet restoration targets for specific habitats and species, with the aim of covering at least 20% of the region’s land and sea areas by 2030. But quarrels over exemptions and flexibility clauses allowing member states to skirt the rules plagued negotiations.",
            "The bill was adopted earlier by a 329-275 vote with 24 abstentions after the center-right Christian Democratic European People’s Party of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen decided to vote against it.",

            "A major part of that is its plan to sell off AirAsia's core short-haul aviation business, comprising several regional subsidiaries, from Capital A Berhad to its Malaysia-listed sister firm Air Asia X — its mid- to long-haul business. That will create a unified Air Asia Group, Fernandes said, which is targeting a $400 million equity raise, according to Reuters.",
            "Subject to regulatory approval, the deal finalized Wednesday with Aetherium Acquisition Corp.— a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC — will result in Capital A International going public on the Nasdaq stock exchange. A SPAC is a publicly traded company formed solely to merge with or acquire another company, providing it with a swifter path to a stock market listing.",

            "\"Why a SPAC? I see it really as a reverse listing in America,\" Fernandes said. \"SPACs have got a bad name because a lot of these were, I'm going to be frank, hair-brained business schemes, sending people to the moon… We're generating real cash flow, real profits,\" he added.",
            "On a smaller scale, AirAsia's path will mirror that of Singapore-based, Southeast Asia-focused Grab, a \"super app\" service which began trading on the Nasdaq in Dec. 2021 after closing a SPAC merger.",

Anyone could submit a nomination on behalf of any woman from any company or organization with at least $25 million in revenue in at least one of the past three years or an enterprise value of at least $100 million. Nominees/nominators were asked to complete a detailed nomination form. This questionnaire contained quantitative and qualitative information which was used as the basis for CNBC's evaluation.",

This could be anything from launching a new product or service, to leading a turnaround effort, to sparking a viral cultural moment or movement. Whatever it was, it was important in the selection process that we identify a reason why each woman named to the list deserved the honor this year. Next year, we'll choose a whole new list of 50 women, and it is entirely possible that many of those women were nominated this year.",
            "In all, CNBC received more than 700 nominations from women across the business and cultural landscape, from companies and organizations ranging from small startups to the world's most valuable multinationals.",
            "The evaluation of the 700-plus nominees began with a quantitative assessment. Nominees were evaluated on five broad categories: results of the achievement in 2023; influence of the individual woman leader; reach of the company/organization, representation, and experience. Nominee scores in each category were then weighted according to a survey completed by members of the Changemakers Advisory Board. The board determined that \"Results\" and \"Influence\" were the most important categories, while \"Experience\" was given the lowest weighting of the five categories.",
            "After the quantitative evaluation, approximately one-third of the nominees were selected to move forward to a second round, which included a qualitative assessment, based on their weighted total scores. To move on to round two, nominees either scored in the top 25% overall, scored in the top 25% in a key category (such as \"startup founder\" or \"nonprofit CEO\"), or they received a recommendation from one or more of the Advisory Board members as part of their initial survey.",
            "For round two, the remaining nominees were divided into groups of 30 for qualitative assessment. A team of CNBC editorial staff, along with members of the Advisory Board, read the responses submitted with each nomination and assigned up to five points for each of three criteria. These were:",
            "Contribution: Looking specifically at the response to \"Contribution to the business world in 2023,\" scorers assessed the contribution the applicant made to the business world, and to broader society, last year.",
            "Transformational Change: Scorers were to assess whether the specific contribution, as well as the balance of the nominee's work, and the manner in which that work is done, represents a fundamental shift in the way business gets done. More specifically, scorers were asked to look for ways in which nominees reject traditional male archetypes of business leadership and lead with their own authentic, unique strengths.",
            "Inspiring Leader: Scorers were asked whether the applicant's story inspires them, and whether it will inspire her employees, customers and investors.",
            "Qualitative scores were added to the quantitative score from round one, with each weighted equally (50% qualitative, 50% quantitative), and nominees were re-ranked according to their total scores.",
            "A smaller group of CNBC editorial senior staff performed a final editorial review, which involved some additional research, discussion and debate to determine the final 50 nominees to make the list. This being the first year, extra scrutiny was applied to the quantitative methodology and the qualitative review to account for potential irregularities in the data as well as for any personal biases. However, two-thirds of the women named to the list ranked in the top 50 before our editorial review.",

It includes 15 startup CEOs and founders whose companies have a total valuation of more than $47 billion, and 11 public company CEOs overseeing firms with a combined market cap of about $170 billion. In addition, it features five women deploying technology to amplify the philanthropic impact of their organizations and four women shaking up the world of sports business. Nearly one-fifth of the women are based outside the U.S.",
            "Each has accomplished a meaningful achievement in 2023, propelling a major business to a new level of growth and often tackling issues of significant importance to society.",
            "Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, secured key manufacturing capacity at the dawn of a blockbuster weight-loss drug era and worked to lower the prices for insulin drugs amid heightened political scrutiny of prescription costs. RePurpose Global CEO and co-founder Svanika Balasubramanian is working to minimize and repurpose plastic waste alongside hundreds of consumer brands. Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has taken on the baby formula shortage with a new product, while Baby2Baby co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof are upending the status quo in diaper manufacturing and distribution.",
            "In some cases, Changemakers are taking their star power to build out new market opportunities. Alex Cooper is changing the podcast business and building a new kind of audio media empire. Actor Tracee Ellis Ross is changing the hair-care industry and more with Pattern Beauty. Naomi Osaka is shaking things up both on the tennis court and off with her media company and skincare line.",
            "In reviewing the Changemakers, CNBC identified a couple of key trends. First, this new generation of women leaders is aligning purpose and profits, creating businesses that succeed when they achieve environmental or social good. At rePurpose Global, Balasubramanian created a model that succeeds when companies take steps to reduce their plastic production and environmental impact. Jessica Chang, the CEO of Upwards, is reimagining the business of child care to make it more widely accessible and affordable. Maayan Cohen created Hello Heart to help individuals manage cardiovascular health, while helping employers manage costs.",
            "Changemakers are also reformers, inventing new approaches to fix broken systems. And many of them are providing female consumers with new, much-needed options in areas that have often been overlooked. Kate Ryder is closing major gaps in women's and family health care with Maven. Mielle Organics founder Monique Rodriguez created new options for natural hair care. National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jessica Berman is proving the broad appeal of women's sports and closing the pay gap among professional athletes.",
            "And we're seeing several women forge new paths in renewable energy, such as Dandelion Energy CEO Kathy Hannun, who is working to create a new market for geothermal energy, and Twelve's Etosha Cave, who is focused on turning CO2 and water into aviation fuel.",
            "While women continue to be underrepresented in the world of technology, and particularly in the cutting-edge area of artificial intelligence, several of this year's Changemakers are playing key roles in using AI to improve and accelerate their businesses and others. Clara Shih, as the CEO of Salesforce AI, is helping companies deploy AI across their organizations. Michelle Zatlyn, co-founder and chief operating officer at Cloudflare, is giving companies AI tools to bolster cybersecurity and lower costs for vulnerable, critical infrastructure providers, including schools and local election systems. Kristin Peck, CEO of animal health company Zoetis, is using AI to improve outcomes for pets and their owners.",
            "All these women are trailblazers in their fields, with inspiring stories and unique approaches. The Changemakers serve as a reminder that success is a result of leading in ways that are authentic."

            "[Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.]",
            "[In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.]",
            "[Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.]",
            "When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.",
            "The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.",
            "That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.",
            "As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.",
            "Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.",
            "TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION",
            "Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.",
            "Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.",
            "\"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\"",
            "The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.",
            "The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.",
            "Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.",
            "\"If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said.",
            "Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.",
            "\"I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\"",
            "She added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\"",
            "REPUBLICAN HOPES",
            "The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.",
            "Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.",
            "Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.",
            "Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.",
            "A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.",
            "\"We’ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\""

This illegitimate inquiry should have ended long before their star witness was indicted for lying but it wasn’t. Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is - on the record and under oath - this political charade should finally come to an end.\"",
            "Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday.",
            "The first son testified that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in a \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry against his father. He also said Republicans have no evidence against his father, the president, \"because there isn't any.\"",
            "Comer, R-Ky., made a public statement Wednesday afternoon, saying that Hunter’s appearance \"was a great deposition for us.\"",
            "Hunter Biden, however, thought the deposition went well for him. On his way out of the hearing room Wednesday, Hunter Biden told reporters he thought the hearing went \"great.\"",
            "A source with direct knowledge of the deposition told Fox News Digital that Hunter Biden \"first made clear in his opening statement and emphasized throughout the deposition, Joe Biden was not involved in, did not benefit from, and took no official actions to benefit any of his business ventures.\"",
            "Regarding the infamous \"10 held by H for the big guy?\" email, the source said Hunter told the committee that his associate who sent the message, James Gilliar, was \"out of his mind for even suggesting Joe Biden get involved in their joint venture.\"",
            "\"Hunter discussed his addiction at length,\" the source said, adding that Hunter \"admitted that he was high or drunk when he sent the ‘sitting here with my father’ WhatsApp message, sent it to the wrong recipient, and is now embarrassed by the message.\"",
            "That text was sent to a business partner for Chinese energy firm CEFC.",
            "The source said Hunter also testified that his dad \"was not sitting next to him.\"",
            "But Comer said after the deposition that \"it proves several bits of our evidence that we've been conducting throughout this investigation.\"",
            "Comer added that \"there are also some contradictory statements that I think need further review.\"",
            "\"So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing,\" Comer said.",
            "Comer stressed that Hunter Biden and his attorney have \"demanded\" a public hearing following the deposition.",
            "\"Just as I said, when we said we were going to do the deposition first, we will have a public hearing next,\" he explained. \"So I think that the public hearing hopefully will clear up some discrepancies between some of the statements that were made between some of the associates and what we heard today.\"",
            "Indeed, Lowell said back in November 2023, \"Hunter is eager to have the opportunity, in a public forum and at the right time, to discuss these matters with the Committee.\"",
            "Comer said \"all in all,\" he is \"very optimistic, very excited about this deposition.\"",
            "\"I look forward to releasing the transcripts as soon as both sides agree to that,\" Comer said, hinting that the first son’s transcript of his deposition could be released to the public by the end of the week. \"Hopefully that'll be within the next 2 or 3 days.\"",
            "During his opening statement Wednesday, obtained by Fox News, Hunter Biden testified that he was present \"to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business.\"",
            "\"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never,\" he stressed. \"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.\"",
            "The first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"",
            "\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.",
            "Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.",
            "House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.",

            "[Biden is hoping to address his deep unpopularity on immigration]",
            "President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.",
            "Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
            "Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.",
            "Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.",
            "CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.",
            "Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in Fiscal Year 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.",
            "Eagle Pass has also been the center of an ongoing standoff and court battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the administration over border-related issues, including setting up razor-wire and a new anti-illegal immigration law.",
            "The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.",
            "\"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said aboard Air Force One on Wednesday. \"He will reiterate his calls for congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.",

            "That silky voice is perhaps best known for a number of erotic novels, including Hood Boyz Fall In Love Too 3, Nobody Can Love You Like Them Roughnecks Do 2, Fallin' For a Miami Hustla 3, and Mated to the Cyborgs.",
            "Nixon, a former police captain, has made a name for himself narrating steamy novels that have received thousands of reviews on Amazon. Those books are considerably more popular than Brown’s Desk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who Changed America, which is ranked 919,374th on Amazon’s best seller charts.",
            "Brown devotes each chapter of Desk 88 to a different senator who once sat at his desk. At several points throughout the book, Brown quotes lawmakers using the N-word. The pallid Brown, whose narration is limited to the chapter titles, lets the African-American Nixon read the slur, which comes twice from the Mississippi Democrat Theodore Bilbo, once from strategist Lee Atwater, and once from former vice president Al Gore, who was himself quoting Strom Thurmond.",
            "A spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Among the figures Brown profiles is former Ku Klux Klan member and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, whom the senator calls a \"complicated but necessary inclusion in a book about great progressives who sat at Desk 88.\"",
            "Fortunately for Brown, Nixon is no stranger to controversy. His voice often divides audiobook lovers, who carry out heated debates in the Amazon comments section. Reviewers were split on Nixon’s narration of What Happens on Vacation: A Flirty Vacation Romance, which details the fictitious African-American senator Jessup Outlaw’s winter romance.",
            "One listener dismisses Nixon’s voice as \"boring,\" while another calls him \"soothing,\" and praises him for guiding \"readers into discovering love.\"",
            "Nixon’s best performance, according to Amazon reviews, comes in The Right Player: A Sports Romance. One fan said Nixon’s voice was \"perfect for an evening on the couch. With your eyes closed so, you can listen and see the story unfold in your imagination.\"",
            "Listeners also raved about Her Naughty Suitor (Falling for a Rose), in which Nixon voices a real estate mogul with a \"desirous craving to explore everything about\" the book’s female protagonist.",
            "\"Oh my Gawd!! Lord, help me. I need a cigarette or a drink after reading ‘Her Naughty Suitor.’ And I don't smoke nor drink,\" one reviewer wrote on Amazon. \"I LOVED IT!!!!\"",
            "Brown is not the first Democrat to intersect with the world of romance novels. Two-time failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams once moonlit as a romance writer, cranking out books including Never Tell, the tale of a criminal psychologist who falls in love with a journalist as they seek to uncover the identity of a serial killer.",
            "Nor is Brown’s book the first foray into politics for Nixon, who took a break from bodice-rippers to help narrate an audiobook of the January 6th report."

He also served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019, and he highlighted in the announcement that he helped secure the confirmations of Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh under former president Donald Trump.",
            "\"We will improve communication, increase transparency, and ensure inclusion of every member’s expertise and opinion,\" he promised. \"We will restore the important role of Senate committees and reestablish the regular appropriations process, rather than lurch from one crisis to another. And we will return power back to our members; there will be no more backroom deals or forced votes on bills without adequate time for review, debate, and amendment.\"",
            "Cornyn, the first to publicly announce his intent to run, is one of several Republicans who could take the leadership role left by McConnell, who announced Wednesday he would step down as the GOP leader in November. Minority whip Sen. John Thune (S.D.) and Senate conference chair John Barrasso (Wyo.) are expected to seek the position. Other potential successors include Sen. Steve Daines (Mont.), now the leader of the NRSC, as well as former NRSC chair Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.) and conference vice chair Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), according to the Washington Post."

            "The war in Ukraine has triggered the worst crisis in Moscow's relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, but his nuclear warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit.",
            "Addressing lawmakers and other members of the country's elite, Putin, 71, repeated his accusation that the West was bent on weakening Russia, and he suggested Western leaders did not understand how dangerous their meddling could be in what he cast as Russia's own internal affairs.",

            "\"But now the consequences will be far more tragic,\" said Putin. \"They think [war] is a cartoon,\" he said, accusing Western politicians of forgetting what real war meant because they had not faced the same security challenges as Russians had in the last three decades.",
            "Russian forces now had the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine and were advancing in several places, Putin said. Russia must also boost the troops it has deployed along its western borders with the European Union after Finland and Sweden decided to join the NATO military alliance, he added.",

            "[He stole Supreme Court seats, thwarted accountability for Donald Trump, and left a trail of partisan destruction in his wake.]",
            "On February 7, 2017, one of the darker days of his long, dark tenure as one of the most cynical partisans ever to serve in the Senate, then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prevented Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren from reading aloud a historic letter from Coretta Scott King that recalled some of the worst abuses of voting rights by then-Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Sessions, a conservative Republican whose nomination to serve as then-President Donald Trump’s first Attorney General was under consideration by the chamber, was an ally of McConnell’s. More importantly, he was a fellow Republican. And the all-powerful majority leader decided he had heard more than enough criticism about his partisan compatriot’s sordid history of seeking to suppress the Black vote in Alabama.",
            "So McConnell employed a rule that bars a senator from ascribing “to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator” to silence his Democratic colleague—even though Warren was merely reading a letter from the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that described actual events and that was already a part of the Congressional Record. Sputtering with frustration, the majority leader went to the floor and infamously grumbled in his scolding tone, “Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”",
            "Seven years later, Warren still persists, having long ago turned McConnell’s words into a rallying cry for progressive women. She’s all but certain to win a new term, extending a distinguished Senate career that is likely to see her rise to the chairmanship of one or more key committees. Her contribution to the chamber has been great, and it will be greater.",
            "McConnell, on the other hand, is calling it quits after 17 years as the Senate Republican leader—six of them as majority leader—in which he invariably put party ahead of country and did more long-term damage to American democracy than any member of the Senate in modern US history.",
            "McConnell is the longest-serving Senate leader ever, but he is headed for the exits at the nadir of his power. If he once ruled as a mighty “lion of the Senate,” he leaves as something more like an 82-year-old toothless tiger. He’s now the minority leader in a chamber led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. The Republican who once shaped the party’s direction not just on Capitol Hill but in Senate races across the country is on the outs with the base of a Grand Old Party where Trump—who despises McConnell—has shaped a cult of personality so intense that no room is left for leaders other than the former president. When McConnell returns to his home state for political events, he is heckled and met with cries of “Retire!” Now he has begun the process of heeding those calls.",
            "“One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,” McConnell told colleagues Wednesday. “So I stand before you today… to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.”",
            "But don’t fret for McConnell, who will keep collecting his government checks, while he serves out the remainder of his seventh term. If awards are being handed out for political longevity, give him one. But McConnell’s record of partisan conniving and moral compromising merits no applause.",
            "One of two current senators who witnessed the 1963 March of Washington for Jobs and Freedom—he was a sympathetic House intern looking on from near the Capitol, while Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, marched and rallied with the massive crowd of civil rights activists—McConnell arrived in the Senate in 1985 with a record as a something of a moderate on issues of race and labor rights, like his Kentucky mentors, Republican Senators John Sherman Cooper and Marlow Cook. But he quickly adjusted himself to the rightward thrust of a party in the thrall of then-President Ronald Reagan.",
            "Where Cooper had courageously opposed Republican President Richard Nixon’s pursuit of the Vietnam War, and where Cook cast a decisive vote in opposition to Nixon’s nomination of Judge G. Harrold Carswell, a Georgian with a track record of supporting segregation, to serve on the US Supreme Court, McConnell became the ultimate GOP hack. When it mattered most, he put party above the cooperation, party above the common good, party above the truth, and, ultimately, party above the Constitution.",
            "McConnell once notoriously declared that his highest political priority was unseating Democratic President Barack Obama, and he constantly manifested that same level of remorseless partisanship. Even when Obama was advancing legislation that would help Kentucky, in the form of the Affordable Care Act, McConnell moved to block it, leading a frustrated Cook to denounce his former aide and say, “If he had any knowledge of the lack of health and medical facilities in the hills of Kentucky, he’d know it’s a problem we need to solve. For Mitch McConnell to decide the new health program is not good for Kentucky—it tells me he’s not looking out for his own constituency.”",
            "As Capitol Hill’s most ardent advocate for big money in politics, and a prodigious fundraiser, McConnell kept his seat. And he used his growing power in the Senate to engage in ever more egregious acts of partisanship. Perhaps most brazenly, his cynical manipulation of the judicial confirmation process in 2016 prevented consideration of Judge Merrick Garland, a highly qualified if blandly moderate federal jurist, to serve on the US Supreme Court.",
            "McConnell’s refusal to allow the Senate to take up the Garland nomination relied on an obvious lie: the claim that the Senate could not weigh high court nominations in presidential election years. In fact, the then-majority leader was simply keeping the seat open until a Republican president could fill it with a right-wing judicial activist. After Donald Trump’s election, McConnell promptly steered Neil Gorsuch to confirmation in 2017. Then, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death created an election-year opening on the court in 2020, McConnell shamelessly raced to fill the seat with conservative Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett—finishing his long mission of tipping the balance on the court so that it had an aggressively hard-right, anti-abortion majority. In less than two years, 50 years of precedent was overturned, as McConnell’s court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the way for states to block access to reproductive rights.",
            "It is fair to say that McConnell’s judicial machinations will be his longest-lasting legacy. Decades from now, Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, whose tenures McConnell made possible, will be undermining civil liberties and upending protections for economic, social, and racial justice. But there is a powerful case that McConnell’s most miserable dereliction of duty came when he defended a Republican president he didn’t even like—and who didn’t like him.",
            "After the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a bipartisan House majority voted to impeach Donald Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. McConnell knew full well that Trump deserved to be convicted for the high crimes and misdemeanors the 45th president had committed. The Kentuckian effectively acknowledged as much with a speech to the Senate, in which he said: “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day. The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president. And their having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories, and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth.”",
            "With this understanding, McConnell should have rallied Senate Republicans to vote to hold Trump to account. Had he done so, there’s a good chance that a sufficient number of additional Republicans would have followed their leader in doing the right thing—creating the two-thirds majority that was needed to convict.",
            "But McConnell refused to do the right thing. He voted to acquit, and did more to renew Trump’s political prospects than any other Republican.",
            "McConnell swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For reasons of partisanship and personal political advancement, he abandoned that oath. Nothing more needs to be said of him."

            "[A recent exhibition documenting four centuries of art from female painters and illustrators provides a new way of looking at an era of art history where women are often left out.]",
            "It’s been more than 50 years since Linda Nochlin set the world of art history atremble. In 1971, her provocative essay for Art News, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” shrewdly answered and deconstructed the seemingly naïve question it posed. For as Nochlin explained, “The question…is simply the top tenth of an iceberg of misinterpretation and misconception; beneath lies a vast dark bulk of shaky idées reçues about the nature of art and its situational concomitants, about the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this.”",
            "Nochlin’s idea that the social order is what makes great art possible—or not, as the case may be—is as incomplete as it is irrefutable, for it fails to explain why, within a certain social structure that supports or obstructs artistic activity, some people turn out to be much better at it than others. To ascribe it to randomness, some statistical variation, is even less satisfactory than the old idea of genius. Besides, it’s clear, in retrospect, that Nochlin was hardly as free of the stereotype of the “great artist” as she would have liked to be. She explains in detail, for instance, the exclusion of women from the study of the nude—for centuries the very basis for the idea of form in painting, and therefore an exclusion from, as she says, “the necessary preparation for achieving mere proficiency, much less greatness, in the realm of art.” What she doesn’t directly contest is the idea that art—or at least great or “supremely great” art—is the work of a professional painter operating according to the academic standards of the time. By contrast, the “modest, proficient, self-demeaning level of amateurism” demanded of women artists seems to her self-evidently incapable of producing anything of lasting value.",
            "In the wake of Nochlin’s essay, attempts to expand knowledge of women’s contributions to the history of European painting became more numerous. Notable among these, in 1979, was The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work by Germaine Greer—perhaps significantly, not a professional art historian like Nochlin, but an indefatigable researcher: Reviewing Greer’s book, Nochlin found “the sheer volume of examples she presents” an obstacle to its cohesion. Nochlin, in collaboration with Ann Sutherland Harris, organized a large-scale exhibition, “Women Artists: 1550–1950,” which traveled to four American museums from 1976 to ’77; all 37 of the artists included were primarily painters.",
            "Nochlin’s perception, in her 1971 essay, that at least through the mid-20th century, there had been “no supremely great women artists, as far as we know,” but nonetheless “many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or appreciated,” was well supported by these efforts, but the simple question remains: How great is “supremely great”? A few of the women painters of the past are now accorded far higher status than they once were.",
            "It’s true that Caravaggio’s reputation as a revolutionary force in Italian art remains unmatched, but Artemisia Gentileschi now overshadows all the other artists who drew on his influence. Édouard Manet, likewise, may still be seen as the key figure in the emergence of modernism in 19th-century Paris, but among those who recognized and built on his achievement, Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot appear far more important today than they did 50 years ago; the specific qualities of their work, unshared by their contemporaries, have come into focus. Paula Modersohn-Becker outshines most of her German Expressionist colleagues. And while Jackson Pollock remains the Abstract Expressionist par excellence, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell are now better appreciated than some of the male painters who were once accounted as his near-equals—Franz Kline, for example. Is just plain old “great” not great enough without the “supremely” added like a cherry on top?",
            "I’m as happy as anyone can be for the chance to enjoy the work of a great artist, or a supremely great one, or even just an almost great one. I’m just as grateful to be reminded of how much beauty and pleasure we sometimes overlook in our frantic hunt for the great. Some of that beauty and pleasure has been brought into the world by those “interesting and very good artists” who were hoping to achieve greatness and didn’t quite make it; but much more, perhaps, came from the hands of “modest, proficient” amateurs who never intended to conquer fame but simply to please themselves and the people immediately around them.",
            "That, at least, is my takeaway from “Making Her Mark: A History of Women Artists in Europe, 1400–1800,” which I recently saw at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The show was curated by Andaleeb Badiee Banta, Alexa Greist, and Theresa Kutasz Christensen, and will also be shown in Toronto at the Art Gallery of Ontario from March 30 to July 1. Here, at last, was an exhibition illuminating—more than Nochlin and Harris’s relatively more conventional “Women Artists” exhibition could have done—what Nochlin called “the nature of art and its situational concomitants…the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this.”",
            "That this would not be a show of “great painting” but something quite different was announced, in a sly way, at the very entrance, where its title and introductory wall text were highlighted by an imposing, elaborately carved wooden frame, more than 10 feet high and six and a half feet wide. This turns out to be the show’s first exhibit: Created in London around 1671, it was meant for a judge’s portrait; the painting no longer exists, but the frame is still here. Its maker was named Mary Ashfield, and she was one of the many women engaged in frame-making in London at the time. She earned £12 for this piece of work, which now lacks its original gilding.",
            "Like this imposing frame, quite a few of the most outstanding things in “Making Her Mark” are marginal to the category of art as conventionally understood but nonetheless the work of highly skilled professionals. Among the show’s most fascinating pieces are its many examples of botanical, zoological, and other types of scientific illustration. These include published engravings, but many of the most striking examples are unique watercolors: for instance, those created by Giovanna Garzoni (who was also a painter of some prominence) in 17th-century Rome, or by Elizabeth Blackwell, who in the 18th century compiled a herbal—in order to pay off her husband’s debts—based on specimens in London’s Chelsea Physic Garden, which is still in existence today. On the basis of her watercolors, Blackwell created the hand-colored engravings and etchings for a book she published in 1739.",
            "Such botanical illustrations demanded great precision and carried a great deal of information about their subjects, but they also offered their makers great scope for invention, and even a kind of disciplined fantasy. Blackwell’s work, in particular, is of a breathtaking delicacy. But more than that, her images practically vibrate with life. Most extraordinary of all, perhaps, is her vision of a yellow asphodel, with its long, slender, sinuously meandering leaves, which look as if they are drifting about languidly in some fluid medium. If you Google this plant today, you might find that it “features a clump of narrow, linear, grassy, gray-green leaves to 12 [inches] tall”—but how drily austere that sounds in comparison to the oddly seductive vision of this plant that Blackwell offers.",
            "Another memorable watercolor of putatively naturalistic purport is one attributed to Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff, a German specialist in botanical illustration who worked in Amsterdam and later moved to the Dutch colony of Surinam. She learned from and collaborated with her mother, Maria Sibylla Merian, who was best known for her illustrations of caterpillars, and with her sister. Seen as a piece of scientific illustration, Herolt-Graff’s Three Mice Nibbling Fruits and Nuts (ca. 1690–1710), presents a quandary: Are the plants the main subject, or the hungry animals? I’d say it’s neither, but rather the at once destructive and sustaining act of eating itself, which in this hyper-real image (almost hallucinatory) appears both sinister and paradisiacal, like some lost detail from Hieronymous Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights.",
            "A step beyond scientific illustration are the uncannily realistic porcelain flowers made, circa 1748, at the Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres in France by an atelier of female ceramicists and painters under the direction of Marie-Henriette Gravant. These minutely detailed little knickknacks were, it seems, a particular delight of the king’s mistress, Madame de Pompadour. From the wall label, we learn that she enjoyed “perfuming them to create the scented illusion of a garden indoors.” Today, without this aroma, they exude a surreal sense of petrified life.",
            "Artists like Blackwell and Herolt-Graff were professionals whose intensity of vision lent their ostensibly pragmatic and utilitarian art a beauty and strangeness unaccounted for by the information it was designed to convey. But there’s also plenty of genteel amateurism on display, which transcended the limited scope of its makers’ ambition. Occasionally, the same person could play both roles. One example is Anna Maria Garthwaite. On the one hand, she was a hugely successful designer of silk textiles in 18th-century London; her opulently rococo art is represented in “Making Her Mark” by watercolors, swatches of fabric, and full garments. But her most striking work in the show was unrelated to this profession. It was something that must have been done as a hobby: an intricate but folksy silhouette image in black paper, showing—as it was described when auctioned at Christie’s in London in 1993 (it now belongs to the Victoria and Albert Museum)—“an English manor house, within fenced gardens and extensive woodland landscape, with gardeners, huntsmen, horses and carriages, deer and hounds, a church and village to the west of the house.” All that, in a finely cut sheet not much more than 15 inches across, in a naïvely geometrical style that couldn’t be further from the rich floral curves of Garthwaite’s textile design patterns. Whatever her reason for creating this piece, it was very distinct from her commercial endeavors.",
            "In spirit, Garthwaite’s silhouette is closer to the flat, highly patterned representations found in many embroideries, samplers, and other examples of craftwork that were considered suitable pastimes for virtuous women and girls. Take a work bag made in Britain in 1669 by a 10-year-old with the initials I.S., a marvel of patience as well as of fine stitchery. Also presumably the work of a devoted amateur is an amazingly elaborate piece of quillwork—filigree made of rolled paper—made in the 18th century, though who knows where or by whom. It’s essentially a ridiculously ornate frame, about 11 by 14 inches, for a tiny picture (a disc of about an inch and a half in width) of the Madonna and Child. Quillwork, we are told, was considered “an affordable way to decorate everything from reliquaries to furniture, altarpieces, and small works for both personal devotion and domestic decoration, like this example.” And while it may have been materially inexpensive, how dear must have been the time spent on it!",
            "But with this anonymous piece, I find myself back at my starting point: a frame becoming more important than the painting it’s meant to set off or supplement. It thus evokes, like it or not, the philosopher Jacques Derrida’s famous paradox of the parergon, the framing or supplement that is purported to be secondary to the artwork itself but turns out to be essential. Need it be pointed out that this accords with the position of women in relation to art, at least during the period covered by “Making Her Mark”? At best, somewhere on the edge of art, somewhere around it but not quite in it—involved in an activity with a certain similarity to art but either too personal, too amateur, or else too much of a business enterprise, never quite properly artistic.",
            "That’s not to say, of course, that the exhibition does not also include its fair share of things that are unmistakably high art, above all history paintings like the two interpretations of a biblical story that one might, if one wished, take as an allegory for woman’s revenge on her male oppressor: Judith with the head of Holofernes. As painted in 1596 by the Milanese artist Fede Galizia, Judith exhibits a strange serenity beside her decapitated Assyrian foe. But her elderly maid looks on with an expression of perplexity, and the composition creates an ambiguity about the three hands that surround the severed head and the platter below: the hand cradling the tray must be the servant’s, the hand holding the head by its hair ought to be Judith’s, and yet it never becomes quite possible to see it that way without forcing oneself, imposing narrative logic on a recalcitrant visual puzzle. Artemisia Gentileschi’s version, painted around 1623–25, is an altogether more dramatic—and dramatically lit—composition. But this Judith doesn’t bother with the head she’s just severed; with a strange gesture toward the single candle illuminating the scene, she seems to hush its light, while leaving the cleanup to the ever-dependable maid.",
            "Just as the frame can overpower the painting, “Making Her Mark” turns the tables on a few centuries’ worth of established artistic hierarchies, fulfilling Nochlin’s call for equality in a way that Nochlin herself—because she could not question the idea of “that total inner confidence, that absolute certitude and self-determination, moral and esthetic, demanded by the highest and most innovative work in art”—could not succeed in doing. In that sense, the exhibition represents a late (albeit not a moment too soon) consequence of the great wave of second-generation feminism. But it’s not only Nochlin’s (and Greer’s, and so many others’) determination to recover the memory of so much silenced effort by so many women that has finally made such an exhibition possible. It’s also reflective of a broader shift in our sense of what the very word “art” means.",
            "That shift was certainly caused, in part, by that same second-wave feminism, which generated a passionate interest in forms of creativity that had previously been deemed sub-artistic, categorized as craft rather than art, and often practiced by women. It was also a product of the rise, starting in the late 1960s, of what can now be called conceptual art: a new way of looking at things according to which, at least under certain circumstances, functional everyday objects, images meant to convey empirical information rather than aesthetic feeling, and images that reiterate already existing imagery (like the many works in the show based on drawing exercises and textile pattern books) can have the same artistic status as unique paintings and sculptures. Think of Lorraine O’Grady’s 1983 work Art Is…, in which performers framed the spectators of an African American Day Parade on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard in Harlem, turning everyone into an embodiment of art. It’s this expansion of the possible range of reference of the word “art” that helps make it possible to see today the artistic value of china plates, lace, and so many of the other objects in this exhibition.",
            "In the catalog for “Making Her Mark,” its project is described—in implicit contrast to Nochlin’s accent on the “supremely great”—as a search for “the unexceptional woman artist.” I think that might be misguided. I’m not sure art of any sort can be made in the absence of an impulse to be exceptional—and this exhibition proves it. For some, the arena in which one strives to achieve distinction may be, as it was for Gentileschi, the apex of European society, or it might be a small circle of intimates. As we all know, time has a way of leveling those differences. May the leveling continue."

            "[For the fourth time since January, Congress is facing a deadline to fund essential spending priorities. The House GOP has neither shame nor sense of responsibility.]",
            "Welcome back, my friends, to the shit show that never ends. For the fourth time in its brief tenure, the 118th Congress is on the brink of a government shutdown, with a fifth deadline to fund essential spending priorities just a week behind this Saturday’s cutoff date. (This tally doesn’t even count the near-death debt-ceiling deal last spring—the accord that set former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on a path to dismissal at the hands of eight professionally outraged hard-right members.)",
            "When McCarthy’s eventual successor, Mike Johnson, cut his own deal to approve a continuing resolution to avert a shutdown in January, he tried to tamp down a brewing revolt among the members of the anti-government Freedom Caucus with a bit of scheduling legerdemain. In lieu of using a big deadline to produce an ungainly omnibus deal to keep the government funded, Johnson proudly debuted a two-tiered spending deadline. The first tranche of funding bills—enabling the continued operations of the departments of Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, Housing, and Transportation—would need to secure passage in the House by March 1. The next batch of spending bills, slated to expire March 8, pay for everything else, namely the departments of Justice, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, State, Education, Interior, and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the legislative branch.",
            "With a straight face, Johnson proclaimed that this staggered approach to the main business of the House—minding the government’s purse strings—would permit his fractious conference, operating with a razor-thin majority, to better advance and secure its legislative priorities. “We’re not surrendering, we’re fighting,” the new speaker said at the time. “But you have to be wise about choosing your fights.”",
            "Now, Johnson’s self-touted wisdom is bearing fruit—with the same desperate rush to avert a shutdown that provoked the January deal. The GOP House conference, already boasting historic levels of legislative inactivity, confronted Saturday’s shutdown deadline with the sage circumspection that it’s displayed since the new majority was seated last January: It took an extended recess and returned with no coherent plan of action. So Johnson once again faces the least palatable option for the survival of his speakership: obtaining a rules suspension to broker a spending deal that relies on Democratic support to get passed.",
            "“What’s stunning to me is that you’ve got the shutdown deadline, and you’ve got Ukraine funding, funding for Israel and the border and Taiwan,” Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress watcher and emeritus fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told me. “You have all these critical issues, but Republicans take longer recesses than usual.” This dilatory approach to the GOP’s self-imposed deadline, combined with the power dynamics under a shrinking House majority, leave Johnson in a tighter spot to produce results than he was in during the January spending wars. “If they fuck this up and can’t make it work, and Johnson somehow brings a plan up under suspension, this is one where you’re going to need a substantial number of Republicans on board,” Ornstein said. “If you’re looking at the [supplemental] funding bill for Ukraine and Israel, you’re going to lose some Democrats because of Israel funding, so you’ll need a significant number of Republicans.”",
            "It’s also an election year, which makes it especially difficult for Republican lawmakers to make the case to hold on to and expand their House majority, or christen a new Senate one, when they’ve throttled basic government services—on top of their leadership battles and operatic culture-war inquisitions. That’s why Johnson’s Senate counterpart Mitch McConnell is already lobbying him to avert a shutdown: McConnell knows that, even with a 2024 map that favors a GOP Senate majority, pulling the plug on federal services could lead to electoral disaster. That’s the unmistakable lesson of past GOP-engineered shutdowns, from the 1995–96 Gingrich-authored debacle to Donald Trump’s border-wall fiasco of 2018.",
            "Johnson has conducted a frantic round of meetings with Senate leaders and President Joe Biden trying to forestall a partial shutdown by the end of the week. In his most recent White House confab with Biden, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, Johnson met the Democrats’ pleas to approve Ukraine funding with a renewed push to move forward on border security—even though the Senate-brokered bill on the issue has been denied a floor vote at the behest of Johnson’s chief political retainer, former president Donald Trump. Johnson, in other words, is not merely content with repeating the Beckett-style negotiations over a shutdown on autoplay; he’s going out of his way to draw attention to the greatest, self-inflicted legislative cock-up of the 118th Congress. This really says everything about today’s class of Republican lawmakers: Even as they reckon with preordained policy doom, they’re unable to come up with any fresh material. “It’s such an embarrassment to any concept of responsibility, of following the oath they all took, of running a critical institution,” Ornstein said. “And that they have no shame about it, that just compounds everything.”"

            "[The “Uncommitted” vote was a measure of frustration with Biden’s stance on Gaza, and it was up dramatically from past primaries.]",
            "The last time an incumbent Democratic president ran in a Michigan presidential primary, 20,833 Democrats voted “Uncommitted.”",
            "That was in 2012, when President Barack Obama secured 90 percent of the vote in a low-turnout primary. Obama went on to carry the battleground state with relative ease in November.",
            "This year, President Joe Biden was hoping for a similar show of support from all the constituencies that form the Democratic base in Michigan, a battleground state he desperately needs to win in what’s shaping up as a close November contest with Republican former president Donald Trump. That’s one of the reasons the Biden team and its allies at the Democratic National Committee moved Michigan’s primary to a position near the start of the 2024 nominating process. But on Tuesday night, primary voters in Michigan sent a very different message than the one the president was looking for. More than 100,000 of them checked the “Uncommitted” box—five times as many as did so in 2012.",
            "As of early Wednesday morning, with 95 percent of the total counted, Biden had received just over 81 percent of the vote, while 13.3 percent chose the “Uncommitted” option on the Michigan ballot. The remaining votes went to author and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, who has suspended her 2024 bid, and US Representative Dean Phillips (D-Mich.).",
            "It’s no secret why “Uncommitted” performed so strongly. The protest vote offered an opportunity to express outrage over Biden’s hands-off approach to Israel’s assault on Gaza. That military offensive, launched after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has left almost 30,000 Palestinian civilians dead. More than 12,000 of the casualties are children.",
            "Biden has been warned for months, by critics and allies, that his unstinting support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war would put his campaign in peril. With Tuesday’s vote, which came at a point when the president and his aides say they are working to ease the violence in Gaza but have yet to achieve anything akin to an agreement for a permanent cease-fire, a substantial portion of Michigan Democrats showed him that they weren’t bluffing. Their message was blunt: Biden’s presidency could hang in the balance if he doesn’t pay attention to voters he needs in November.",
            "“Every person who voted ‘Uncommitted’ today was personally compelled to use their voice to speak out against President Biden’s support of Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,” said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, a heavily Democratic city of almost 110,000 that is home to the largest Muslim population, per capita, in the United States—and where the “Uncommitted” option was beating Biden by a 56-40 margin. “Today, thousands said, ‘Enough’. As American citizens and Michigan voters, we have made our voices heard at the ballot box. Now, it is up to President Biden to listen to Michigan and do the right thing.”",
            "The “right thing” was defined during the primary campaign by the “Listen to Michigan” movement, which was organized just three weeks ago to urge voters who are angry with Biden’s Gaza stance to cast “Uncommitted” ballots in order to deliver a message to the president. The campaign, which drew support from US Representative Rashida Tlaib and dozens of elected Democrats, as well as activist groups and Detroit’s Metro Times, focused on a pair of fundamental themes: the moral necessity for Biden and his foreign policy team to support an immediate and permanent cease-fire in order to stop the killing in Gaza; and the political necessity for Biden and his reelection campaign to recognize that Arab American voters, Muslim voters, young voters, and a substantial number of Black voters want a new direction when it comes to US policies regarding Israel and Palestine. All of those constituencies are key to Democratic prospects in Michigan, a swing state, where Biden trails Trump in most recent polls.",
            "Michigan has for many years been one of America’s most closely contested battleground states. In 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton struggled to mobilize party constituencies, she lost Michigan to Trump by a little more than 10,000 votes, for a 0.23 percent margin. Four years later, when Biden maximized his appeal to the party base, the Democrat beat the Republican by roughly 155,000 votes, for a 2.78 percent margin.",
            "This year, says former US representative Andy Levin (D-Mich.), “I don’t think that Joe Biden can win the presidency without winning Michigan, and I don’t think that he can win Michigan without a change of course on Gaza.”",
            "Levin is not alone in arguing that if Biden hopes to carry Michigan in November, he must recognize that he’s got a political problem in the state, and that this problem is rooted in anger over his Gaza stance among precisely the voters that he needs to win. Those voters are in places like Wayne County—with its large Arab American communities in Dearborn and Hamtramck, and its large Black population in Detroit and other communities—and Washtenaw County, a liberal stronghold where the Democratic vote is powered by student turnout at the University of Michigan campus at Ann Arbor and Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. Those counties registered some of the highest levels of frustration with Biden on Tuesday, as more than 17 percent of voters in Wayne and Washtenaw cast “Uncommitted” ballots.",
            "Among Muslim voters, the numbers were most dramatic. An exit poll conducted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and its Michigan chapter, suggested that over 90 percent of Michigan Muslims who were contacted for the survey had voted “Uncommitted.”",
            "“What we know is this: Michigan is going to be a significant state in November, and there are a significant number of pro-peace, anti-war voters in Michigan,” explained Michigan State House majority leader Abraham Aiyash, a Democrat who said that, while “Donald Trump is by far the worst and most reckless candidate running for president,” many Michiganders believe that “Joe Biden hasn’t done enough to stop the mass slaughter and suffering of the Palestinians. We can and will demand more from the president.”",
            "Aiyash says Michigan Democrats will take that demand to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer, where they will push not just for a permanent cease-fire but for cutting US military aid to Israel. If Biden and the Democrats do not respond, suggests Aiyash, they risk the prospect of losing both Michigan and the presidency.",
            "Michigan’s volatility has made it an essential swing state for many years. But it could be even more critical in 2024. That’s because several states that Biden carried in 2020, including Georgia and Nevada, could be harder to win this year. So the president needs Michigan. Yet the “Uncommitted” vote of Tuesday signals that he has a lot of work to do if he hopes to unite and turn out the whole of the Democratic base.",
            "James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab-American Institute, and a longtime member of the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee, summed up the message from Michigan on Tuesday warning Biden, “Read the room…. Change policy & promote justice for Palestinians—or risk losing.”"

            "[Following Washington’s lead, key US allies have cut funding for the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestine—making them all complicit in genocide.]",
            "When the 17 judges of the International Court of Justice issued their near-unanimous ruling on January 26, making clear that Israel’s actions in Gaza plausibly constituted genocide, they asserted the legitimacy of the world’s most influential judicial body to hold Israel provisionally accountable for those violations.",
            "Israel was having none of it.",
            "Just hours after the court’s decision was announced in The Hague, Israel went public with an unsubstantiated allegation that 12 Gazan employees of the UN’s Relief Works Agency, the primary body responsible for providing humanitarian support to Palestine refugees, supposedly were tied to Hamas and may have played some role in the attack on Israel on October 7. (In fact, the names of all UNRWA employees had been provided to Israel earlier in the year for Tel Aviv’s vetting—and Israel made no complaints.) Despite the lack of evidence, UNRWA—presumably in an effort to avoid a dangerous collective punishment by Israel’s allies—immediately announced that it was firing the named employees (two were confirmed dead) and the UN launched two separate investigations.",
            "Not wanting to wait a moment, however, Washington announced on the same day that it was cutting its entire aid allocation to UNRWA, despite the agency’s irreplaceable role in getting desperately needed aid into Gaza. A few hours later, key US allies announced that they were joining Washington in cutting aid: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and new NATO-member Finland. The United States provides by far the largest annual donation available to the UN agency (although, at just over $300 million, it’s a pittance compared to the almost $4 billion the US sends to the Israeli military every year). And combined with the at least 15 countries that eventually joined the US cuts, the impact on UNRWA’s ability to provide even the most minimal of basic services is enormous. With those services destroyed by Israel’s war, this US role in further undermining Palestinians’ access to water, food, medicine, shelter, and fuel makes Washington—again —directly complicit in Israel’s genocide.",
            "Then things got worse. Two weeks later, on February 9, Israel launched another PR attack on UNRWA, this time claiming that a tunnel under the agency’s headquarters in Gaza City had been used by Hamas—variously identified as a communications center, a command center or a data center. Again no evidence was made public, but, among other responses, the US Senate bill authorizing $14 billion for unconditional aid to the Israeli military stated explicitly that none of the bill’s separate humanitarian aid (for conflict zones around the world) could go to UNRWA. US officials themselves had argued earlier that UNRWA was “the only game in town” in terms of getting any significant aid into Gaza, but the bill still imposed a permanent ban on US funding. (If passed by the House, it would even prevent UNRWA from receiving a tiny $300,000 grant that had already been approved.)",
            "The impact of the aid cuts on the already threatened lives of 2.3 million displaced Gazans, as well as millions more Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, can hardly be overstated. US officials who suggested redirection of UNRWA funds to UNICEF and the World Food Program only showed their ignorance of conditions on the ground, and the capacities of aid organizations. UNICEF and WFP together have less than 70 staff on the ground in Gaza; UNRWA has over 13,000 providing, for more than half a century, all the services that ordinarily would be provided by a government civil service. Most of Gaza’s doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, street sweepers are UNRWA employees. Without UNRWA, all the UN agencies and NGOs would be unable to carry out their crucial work. Thousands, probably tens of thousands more civilians—especially babies, children, pregnant women, and the elderly—will die.",
            "And there is another price to be paid as well. Along with its critical role in lifesaving humanitarian assistance, UNRWA remains the only international agency in the UN system whose mandate includes protection of the rights of Palestinians as refugees. The work of UNRWA, from its creation in 1949, was designed to continue until Palestinian refugees achieved “a just and durable solution to their plight” on the basis of all the human rights and refugee rights to which they are entitled.",
            "That means that UNRWA’s work is unfinished until the Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes, guaranteed by international law, is made real. Refugees—dispossessed in 1948 of their homes and land from what is now southern Israel—make up 70 percent of Gaza’s population. Without UNRWA, their right of return, indeed the very existence of Palestinians as a refugee community, is threatened with erasure. And that—creating conditions that make the survival of all or part of a threatened group as a group impossible—is part of the very definition of genocide.",
            "No wonder Israel is so eager to get rid of UNRWA. And for the same reason, no wonder the defense of UNRWA remains such a critical factor in our continuing work for an immediate cease-fire and Palestinian access to unhindered humanitarian assistance in Gaza."

            "[Crystal Clanton became notorious for sending outlandishly racist texts. Now she’s been hired to work for the Justice—and a dubious new story has surfaced to clear her name.]",
            "Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas shocked the legal community when the news broke that one of his new law clerks will be Crystal Clanton—who became notorious in 2015 for apparently sending texts that said, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all . . . I hate blacks. End of story.” For most young lawyers, sending such a text would indeed have been the “end of story.” Instead, Clanton is on the cusp of clinching one of the most coveted prizes in the American legal system. In the past several years, as Clanton has risen through the ranks of conservative legal circles, the story of her alleged racist outburst has been curiously transformed into a tale of victimhood. The new narrative is that Clanton was somehow framed by an unnamed enemy who—for motives that remain unclear—fabricated the racist texts to defame her.",
            "This new account has been greeted with suspicion by many. If the revised story is a lie, then it threatens to implicate not just Justice Thomas, who has endorsed it, but several lower-court federal judges and the leader of a major political group aligned with former President Donald Trump. Indeed, the whole affair may prove one of the most shopworn axioms of political reporting—that the coverup is worse than the crime.",
            "When the vile texts were sent, Clanton was the second-in-command and field director of the hard-right youth group Turning Point USA. The organization, a nonprofit advocacy group closely allied with Donald Trump’s Presidential aspirations in 2024, is well known for poisonous rhetoric: its leader, Charlie Kirk, has recently denigrated Martin Luther King, Jr., as “awful,” questioned whether Black pilots are capable of flying planes, and argued that televised public executions, perhaps by guillotine, should be held in America, with young people watching. Yet, even within Turning Point, colleagues were so shocked by the bluntness of Clanton’s alleged texts that they preserved screenshots of the messages, which were shared in 2017 with The New Yorker. At the time, multiple Turning Point employees told me that Clanton was the author of the messages.",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me, via e-mail, that she didn’t recall sending the texts, and that they seemed out of character. But when she was asked directly if she denied sending them she declined to answer. The screenshots of the messages bore her cell-phone number. Another former Turning Point employee, John Ryan O’Rourke, who was the recipient of the texts, said at the time that he preferred not to discuss them. Several other Turning Point colleagues had also seen and circulated the screenshots. And there was more evidence. In addition to the racist comments, the screenshots show Clanton asking, “Can I come to Starbucks in 5?”; she showed up at one, on cue, a few minutes later. (In 2018, the online platform Mediaite revealed another offensive statement by Clanton, sent on Snapchat. The post featured a photograph of a man who appeared to be Arab, accompanied by a caption that she had added: “Just thinking about ways to do another 9/11.”)",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me that she had resigned from Turning Point. Kirk, her boss at the time, made her departure sound less voluntary. In an e-mail, he told me that, after he learned of the texts, “Turning Point assessed the situation and took decisive action within 72 hours.” Four years later, a spokesman for Turning Point, Andrew Kolvet, confirmed the same set of facts to Ruth Marcus, a columnist for the Washington Post, telling her that Clanton was “terminated from Turning Point after the discovery of problematic texts.”",
            "The story would likely be long forgotten, were it not for an extremely strange plot twist. After the texting scandal, Ginni Thomas, the lobbyist and politically active wife of Clarence Thomas, who had worked closely with Clanton as an adviser to Turning Point, unofficially adopted Clanton as the couple’s protégée. The Thomases harbor deep anger at the mainstream media, stemming in part from the Justice’s embattled 1991 confirmation hearing, and evidently saw in Clanton a fellow-victim. Soon after leaving Turning Point, Clanton started working for Ginni Thomas. Remarkably, the Thomases then invited Clanton to live with them at their home in exurban Virginia, for the better part of the next year. The couple encouraged Clanton to go to law school, and Justice Thomas himself recommended her when she successfully applied to the Antonin Scalia Law School, at George Mason University. Justice Thomas also helped Clanton, who graduated in 2022, line up a prestigious judicial clerkship with Chief Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Pryor is one of the most conservative members of the federal bench, and a well-known “feeder” of clerks to Justice Thomas’s chambers.",
            "Supreme Court clerkships, which last for a year, are extremely valuable in both professional and financial terms. It’s common for former clerks to receive half-a-million-dollar bonuses when they sign on for their first law-firm jobs, and the credential eases the path to coveted academic and political positions. An extraordinary number of Thomas clerks—twenty-two, according to the Associated Press in 2018—populated the high ranks of the Trump Administration or were nominated by Trump for judgeships; others have fanned out across the nation to other prominent posts.",
            "Ordinarily, only the very best law students in the country, with the most impeccable résumés, get a shot at a Supreme Court clerkship. Presumably, a past that included termination for making grotesquely racist statements would present an obstacle. But Ginni Thomas’s intense enthusiasm for Clanton became evident in a leaked video of a 2019 closed-door session of the secretive Council for National Policy, a conservative leadership group to which both Ginni Thomas and Charlie Kirk belong. The video shows her introducing Clanton to the members as her special guest, and saying, “Crystal was for five years Charlie’s right-hand person, the wind in his sails, from a garage organization to this organization. And now she’s the wind in my sails.”",
            "In one sense, it hardly matters whom Justice Thomas hires as a law clerk. His conservative judicial views are well known and unwavering, and it’s improbable that one of his clerks would bend his decisions in any discernible way. Also, had Clanton apologized, it’s unlikely that many people would still care. But hiring a young woman who was fired for racial bigotry, and who has never apologized for it, could scarcely send a worse message to Black litigants and lawyers, or do more to undermine the Court’s promise—carved into its building’s grand façade—to deliver “Equal Justice Under Law.”",
            "Perhaps even more disturbing than Clanton’s hiring is the dubious revisionist history that has emerged to justify her selection. This refashioned narrative threatens to implicate the credibility of some of the most powerful legal officials in the country.",
            "In the fall of 2021, reports surfaced that Clanton had lined up two successive clerkships: the first with U.S. District Court Judge Corey Maze, of the Northern District of Alabama, and the second with Judge Pryor, of the Eleventh Circuit. Ruth Marcus, the Washington Post opinion writer, posted a column asking of Pryor, “Why is a prominent federal judge hiring a law clerk who said she hates Black people?” Democrats on Capitol Hill filed an ethics complaint with the Eleventh Circuit, complaining that Maze and Pryor had hired “an individual with a history of nakedly racist and hateful conduct.” They warned that placing such a person in “close proximity to judicial decision-making threatens to seriously undermine the public’s faith” in the federal courts. And they argued that no member of any minority would “trust that they will receive equal justice before these judges.”",
            "The federal judiciary’s self-policing process is abstruse enough to delight fans of “Bleak House.” The complaint was transferred to the Second Circuit, in New York, where Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, an appointee of George W. Bush, began an inquiry. The confidential process took place behind closed doors, but Bill Rankin, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, obtained letters that Justice Thomas and Judge Pryor sent to the Second Circuit in support of Clanton. Justice Thomas wrote that his wife had “informed me of the horrible way” Clanton “had been treated at Turning Point and asked that she be allowed to live with us.” The implication was that Clanton had been victimized at Turning Point.",
            "Pryor added more detail. He put forward a novel defense of Clanton, which he attributed to conversations he’d had with Justice Thomas, along with a previously unmentioned set of facts provided by Charlie Kirk. According to this new account, Clanton was actually the victim of an unidentified former employee, who, for unknown reasons, had framed her as the author of the racist texts. It was not explained why this outlandishly devious plot hadn’t been exposed earlier—not at the time of her resignation, nor when Clanton was interviewed by The New Yorker, nor during the subsequent four years, when Turning Point’s spokesman consistently confirmed that Clanton had been fired for sending the texts.",
            "According to Pryor’s letter, Clanton had been unable to deny the allegations about the racist texts earlier because she had been bound by a nondisclosure agreement, the existence of which she evidently had failed to mention to reporters at the time. If there was an N.D.A., Clanton also didn’t mention it to a lawyer to whom she referred my questions in 2017. The lawyer, Robert Grabemann, told me that he hadn’t prepared an N.D.A. for her and wasn’t aware that one existed. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at N.Y.U. who is considered a leading authority on questions of judicial ethics, said the claim that an N.D.A. prevented Clanton from telling the truth earlier “is simply not credible,” adding, “I’ve seen my share of N.D.A.s, and I can’t imagine one that would forbid a person to deny making racist statements. I don’t know how one might even word such an N.D.A. To me, this claim is preposterous and strong evidence that information needed for public understanding of these events has been hidden.”",
            "In Pryor’s letter, he said Justice Thomas had assured him that Clanton “was a victim of a pernicious attempt to portray her as a racist.” Kirk, meanwhile, had told Pryor “the media has alleged that Crystal said and did things that are simply untrue.” Instead, Kirk claimed, the real culprit was a former employee who had “created fake text messages to be used against other employees,” in order to make it seem as though they had engaged in misconduct. The real culprit’s name was not identified.",
            "Clanton did not respond to a request for comment. When I reached Kirk to ask him to explain his volte-face on Clanton’s responsibility for the texts, he referred me to his spokesman, who said that he had no comment on the veracity of the new version of the facts, even though it contradicted the explanation that he had provided before. Moreover, when I checked this new account with former Turning Point employees, they hadn’t heard anything about faked texts, or were aware of any other employee having been held responsible for the elaborate ruse. And when Marcus, at the Washington Post, inquired about the new origin story for the texts, a former Turning Point staffer simply replied, “Not fake,” and declined to say more. In a column, Marcus, a graduate of Harvard Law School, deemed the revisionist narrative “not credible.”",
            "Nonetheless, Judge Livingston seemed satisfied. Without obtaining the disputed texts or interviewing key witnesses, she dismissed the ethics complaint against Judge Pryor and Judge Maze. In her ruling, Livingston echoed the claim that the original news coverage was false, and that Clanton had always treated everyone with “kindness, respect and fairness.” She wrote that a Turning Point executive—clearly Kirk—had explained that a different employee “was fired after the organization learned that this person had created fake text messages to be used against coworkers, to make it appear they had engaged in misconduct, when they had not.” Livingston noted that Clanton was highly qualified, and that Pryor and Maze knew about the allegations against Clanton before offering her the coveted clerkships, and that both had determined the allegations of racist behavior by Clanton to be untrue. The “undisputed record,” Livingston concluded, shows that Pryor and Maze “performed all the due diligence that a responsible Judge would undertake.”",
            "Critics howled. Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia on the House Judiciary Committee, who helped initiate the ethics complaint, declared that “the 2nd Circuit’s decision does a disservice to everyone involved,” adding, “This cannot be the end of the matter.” (When I reached out to Livingston, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts replied that misconduct proceedings are “confidential by statute. So Chief Judge Livingston cannot comment.”)",
            "There was one final attempt to get to the bottom of the allegations. The Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee of the U.S. Judicial Conference asked a special committee to gather more evidence. The committee told the Second Circuit that it needed to go back and find out whether Clanton had, in fact, made the racist statements attributed to her, and exactly what Clanton had told Pryor and Maze about the matter. It pointed out that Clanton “has never publicly denied the allegations,” and noted that “there are numerous individuals with first-hand knowledge of the candidate’s alleged conduct.” At a minimum, it said, “the special committee should attempt to interview the candidate and the witnesses identified in the media reports we have cited.”",
            "But that didn’t happen. Instead, Judge Pryor and Judge Maze invoked a legal rule to bar the Judicial Conference from reopening Livingston’s findings. Jeremy Fogel, the director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute and a retired federal judge, told me, in an e-mail, that those who support Justice Thomas’s outlook “likely will argue that this decision clearly is within his discretion as a justice, especially given the close working relationship and level of trust expected between justices and their law clerks.” His critics, however, “will see this as another example of his willingness to ignore ethical rules.” (Justice Thomas and Ginni Thomas declined to comment for this story, as did Judge Maze. Judge Pryor did not respond to a request for comment.)",
            "Either way, with the help of some rather powerful patrons, and a weak judicial-ethics system, Crystal Clanton is on her way to clerk at the highest court in the land. Eric Segall, a law professor at the Georgia State University College of Law, who served in George H. W. Bush’s Justice Department, told me, “Can you imagine what would happen if a Black person who said ‘I hate all white people’ ended up clerking for Sotomayor? You’d never hear the end of it on Fox News. But there’s almost total silence about this.” ♦"

            "Recently, the drag star RuPaul Andre Charles has taken to falling asleep while watching the documentary series “Secrets of Great British Castles.” He’s seen every episode, knows every turn in the bloody histories of landmarks like Dover Castle and the Tower of London. “The headline is: Humans have been horrible since the beginning of time,” RuPaul told me. “And the human ego can justify these terrible things that people do. You know, these kings, Henry VIII, and Edward II, and all these people who have just decimated hundreds of thousands of people because their feelings were hurt.”",
            "RuPaul is braced for conflict. “I’m fearing the absolute worst,” he said. “We are moments away from fucking civil war. All the signs are there.” He continued, “Humans on this planet are in the cycle of destruction. I am plotting a safety net.” He was referring to a fortified compound being constructed on the sixty-thousand-acre ranch of his husband, Georges LeBar, in Wyoming. “I wouldn’t call it a bunker,” he said. But it is designed to withstand calamity. “It’s a lot of concrete and a lot of things. I keep thinking about these castles that I’m going to bed to.”",
            "I met RuPaul at the end of January in Britain, at a rented cottage in Windsor and at Pinewood Studios, nearby, where movie franchises including James Bond and Harry Potter have been filmed. He was shooting “RuPaul’s Drag Race UK,” one of nineteen regional variations of his competition reality show, while promoting a memoir, which will be published this week, called “The House of Hidden Meanings.” (The title comes from a friend’s comment during an acid trip. “After the drugs wore off,” he writes, “I realized it was nonsense.”) RuPaul now hosts seven versions of “Drag Race,” a pastiche of competition reality-television tropes that follows participants, in and out of drag, through eclectic challenges including costume-making, lip-synching, and standup comedy (testing “charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent”—the resulting acronym is representative of the show’s bawdy sense of humor). He has taken an underground, subversive form and made it so mainstream that Nancy Pelosi has appeared as a guest on the show. The sixteenth season of the U.S. version, currently airing, has some of its highest ratings yet, and RuPaul recently won his fourteenth Emmy, making him the most decorated competition host and the most decorated person of color in the award’s history.",
            "“Drag Race” often focusses on competitors who are profoundly marginalized. Almost all the drag queens on the show are queer, and many are people of color, who come from backgrounds where they faced homophobia, racism, or transphobia. For them, drag can be a lifeline, affording a sense of community and an opportunity to transmute stigmatized traits into something exuberant. “It’s armor, ’cause you’re putting on a persona. So the comments are hitting something you created, not you,” Jinkx Monsoon, who has won two seasons of the show, told me. “And then it’s my sword, because all of the things that made me a target make me powerful as a drag queen.”",
            "Yet, as “Drag Race” has become mainstream, a burgeoning culture war has demonized its subject matter. In the past year, lawmakers in at least fifteen states have attempted to ban drag shows, part of a wider queer panic. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, more than four hundred bills that the organization identifies as anti-L.G.B.T.Q.+ are currently under consideration around the country, featuring provisions like curriculum censorship, facilities bans, and mandates that school staff out young people to their families. Drag performances, particularly for child audiences, have recently been cancelled in at least seven countries where “Drag Race” airs. RuPaul, sixty-three, is the world’s most famous drag queen, at the helm of one of the world’s most far-reaching platforms for queer expression. In conservative communities around the country and the world, he often serves as a way in to queer culture. And, for those set against that culture, he represents the dangerous spread of liberal ideas. “He’s seen the way people connect to the show. That’s the way for him to spread the rebuttal to what’s happening in the world,” Randy Barbato, an executive producer of “Drag Race,” said. “His way to ward off the enemy.”",
            "One of RuPaul’s favorite responses, to anyone who asks how he’s doing, is “I don’t see how that’s any of your business.” This is a bit, but it’s also something of a life philosophy. “Ru, he is a study in the private and the public self,” Barbato said. “He’s a public figure. And he’s extraordinarily private.” I have twice appeared as a judge on the American “Drag Race” programs, but our interviews in England were our first substantive exchanges. In advance, I received anxious calls from mutual friends telling me how much RuPaul hates giving interviews, and when I met him, at Pinewood Studios, almost the first thing out of his mouth was “I fucking hate giving interviews.” (The actual first thing he said, after he noticed that I was on crutches, owing to a sprained ankle, was classic “Drag Race” standup: “Fisting accident?” Quoting a contestant on the show, I told him, “There are no accidents in fisting.”)",
            "We sat in a small dressing room dominated by RuPaul’s hair-and-makeup collection, which covered four plastic picnic tables, and by the man himself, who is six-four but is often thought to be taller, probably on account of all the killer heels. (The celebrated drag queen Lady Bunny once described him as “a six-foot-seven monster-model-woman thing.”) RuPaul, on a break between shooting segments in which he would appear out of drag, was without the heels, and instead wore fuzzy gray slippers, a black Abbey Road hoodie, and black workout pants. “I did not think this memoir shit through,” he told me, shaking his head. “It’s presumptuous that the interviewer can interpret my experience.” There’s some irony in this: like many reality shows, “Drag Race” is subject to complaints from competitors who feel unfairly reduced to archetypes. (“It’s nothing like what happened on set,” Phi Phi O’Hara, who was portrayed as hostile toward other contestants, told New York.) RuPaul once recorded a song about the complaints, “Blame It on the Edit,” singing, “You the one who said it, bitch / How you gon’ regret it.” To me, he said, “We’ve had kids come on the show, and we put a camera on them, which can be like a mirror, and they see the reflection of themselves and go, ‘Oh, no, that is not who I am. They must have done something to make me look like that.’ Like Blanche DuBois, they will not see it, then they will fight to the end to say, ‘I was tampered with.’ No, we don’t do that.”",
            "RuPaul’s drag and out-of-drag personas on the show are, essentially, characters. In drag, he’s the candy-colored, Diana-Ross-meets-Bugs-Bunny-meets-Dolly-Parton character he’s built an empire around. (The drag looks featured in each episode take four to six hours to create. His makeup artist, a former contestant named Raven, said, “We do a little brush. We take a break. Coffee talk. O.K., let’s get back to it.”) In the show’s out-of-drag segments, where he introduces challenges or checks in on contestants, offering mentorship and advice, he plays a cheerful, avuncular, professorial type, complete with eyeglasses that he doesn’t really need. Both performances offer touches of ribald humor that pay homage to drag’s more transgressive roots, while sanding off the sharpest of those edges and putting a wholesome face on the form. “I went Disney when I went mainstream,” RuPaul told me. Drag’s evolution from edgy night-club revues to family programming has, predictably, spurred criticism. “What was once counterculture has simply become the Culture,” E. Alex Jung wrote, in New York, in 2019. “This has its benefits: Mainstream consumer culture has gotten a little less straight. But in the process, something—maybe the feeling that this was by us and for us . . . was lost.” RuPaul argued that the full spectrum of drag continues to flourish. The form, he told me, “doesn’t need defending.”",
            "His onscreen personas pull off the trick of revealing—in the show’s monomaniacally branded universe, one would say “ru-vealing”—little about RuPaul himself. Even people who work with him closely can find him distant. His appearances on camera are executed like military strikes; he spends relatively little time with panelists and contestants. “I keep the boundaries,” he said. He mentioned a former colleague who worked with him for decades. “We kept a working relationship, we travelled the world together,” he said. “But sometimes I would hear her talking to a friend, and she’d be talking about her latest boyfriend. She never did that with me, because I’m her boss. And the truth is, I don’t want to hear about it. I don’t care about that shit.”",
            "One of RuPaul’s foundational beliefs is that, as he said, “everybody’s playing a role.” At times, he plays a nurturing one. A staple of “Drag Race” is an interview that finalists have with RuPaul—it is often a “lunch” conducted over a bowl of Tic Tacs—in which they tell him their hopes and fears, and he dispenses therapeutic wisdom. It’s easy to dismiss these exchanges as superficial, but they can be a genuine source of strength for competitors. Jinkx Monsoon recalled that, during their lunch segment, “he was, like, ‘You don’t need to make yourself smaller for other people. . . . And he said that, and it was amazing, because it did make me feel like, Oh, I don’t have to feel guilty for being talented.”",
            "At other times, RuPaul can appear cold, a quality born of painful experience. “So much of our culture today, with young people, is centered around their feelings,” he told me. “Feelings are indicators, they’re not facts.” He went on, “Parents teaching their kids about safe spaces, and ‘I feel uncomfortable’ . . . It’s, like, You know what? The world is not a safe space. You have to find the comfort. It’s mostly uncomfortable.” He told me that he has never wanted children. “I don’t like kids,” he said flatly.",
            "RuPaul was born in San Diego in 1960, the third of four children and the only boy, and brought up in a yellow three-bedroom tract house, one of four models in a housing development called Michelle Manor. According to family lore, before he was born a fortune-teller told his mother, Ernestine, that the baby would be famous. Ernestine introduced him to his aunts by saying, “His name is RuPaul and he’s going to be a star.”",
            "“I was always anointed,” he told me. “I know it sounds obnoxious. But I knew from childhood I was the golden child.” His father, Irving, who worked as an electrician at an aerospace company, was a charming philanderer with a gambling problem. Ernestine, who was of Creole descent, was flinty and aloof, with an immaculate sense of style. Her eviscerating barbs earned her the nickname Mean Miss Charles among the neighborhood kids. “She was a mess,” one of Ru’s older sisters, Renetta, has said, referring to their mother’s temper. “Said what she felt, meant what she said, and you dealt with it.” The parents’ fights could be cataclysmic. At one point, Ernestine poured gasoline over Irving’s convertible, an Oldsmobile Delta 88, and threatened him with a matchbook. RuPaul told me, “They were embroiled in their own two battling nations, and I’m in the middle. So I learned how to be a diplomat and read the situation and go, ‘Oh, can’t say that. How can I say it? I’ll say it like this.’ It’s a dissociative thing that we do to protect ourselves, to not make it personal.”",
            "Irving and Ernestine divorced when RuPaul was seven, and afterward he didn’t see much of his father, whose absence he often describes as a primal trauma. Living with his mother, he witnessed her slide into depression and her sorrow at having allowed herself to be vulnerable enough to be heartbroken—a “softness,” RuPaul writes in “The House of Hidden Meanings,” that she viewed as an “Achilles’ heel.” The complicated and forthright portrayal of her in the book is one of its strongest aspects. “It’s my mother,” he told me, about his own guardedness. “She said I’m way too sensitive. And she was absolutely right. So my job for a lot of time has been to hide the fact that I’m too sensitive.”",
            "Attempting to appeal to his mother, through her often Valium-laced distance, RuPaul would impersonate his favorite divas, wrapping a towel around his head to channel Tina Turner and LaWanda Page, who played Aunt Esther on “Sanford and Son.” (Page later featured on the closest thing RuPaul’s had to a mainstream radio hit, “Supermodel (You Better Work),” from 1992, providing the song’s spoken-word narration about a Black girl escaping from poverty into a life of glamour.) Performance soon became a kind of protection. “I never fit in,” he said. “I wasn’t one of the most desired things on the hit list.” Television offered an escape, and early affirmation of his belief that everyone, everywhere, was playing a character. He liked “Mission: Impossible,” with its complex nesting of disguises, each a layer of defense.",
            "In 1976, when RuPaul was fifteen, he moved to Atlanta with Renetta, who was in her early twenties. They were part of a wave of Black newcomers seeking economic opportunity. He enrolled at the Northside School of Performing Arts, where he appeared in drag for the first time onstage, in the Tennessee Williams play “Camino Real.” After dropping out, he came into contact with the drag scene at a disco called Numbers, where he watched a queen named Crystal LaBeija lip-synch to Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls.” By the eighties, Atlanta was “drag heaven,” Lady Bunny told The New Yorker, in 1993. “Midtown Atlanta was a very gay scene. They had transvestite hookers all over the streets day and night. When we started out, the Southern queens were deadly serious, without a shred of humor.” But RuPaul embraced a genre of drag now known as “genderfuck,” a catchall term for aesthetics that are designed to poke fun at gender norms. In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” he describes the look as “mohawk-and-extensions, tribal apocalyptic Thunderdome.”",
            "Drag brought RuPaul his earliest sense of community, uniting him with kindred misfits. But, with his striking height and confidence, and his new look, he also stood apart. “I thought he had, like, fallen out of the sky,” Larry Tee, the d.j. and club promoter, who was one of his close friends and collaborators during that period, later said. “I thought he was an alien.” In those years, RuPaul was in a constant state of creative self-promotion. He started a series of musical groups, first performing as RuPaul and the U-Hauls, then as Wee Wee Pole. (He made some of his earliest costumes on Renetta’s sewing machine—“tasteful ones,” he writes, “like leopard-print catsuits with fringe down the side.”) He began performing as a go-go dancer, then created his own avant-garde drag revues, which he brought to New York clubs like the Pyramid and Illusions. He advertised these appearances with posters bearing catchphrases like “RUPAUL IS EVERYTHING” and “RUPAUL IS RED HOT,” which he taped to telephone poles. “I have never met anyone in my life that is as driven as RuPaul,” the performer known as Flloyd, another friend from that era, later told a documentarian. “The first day I met him, we drank a whole bottle of Jack Daniel’s and I was laying on the couch going, ‘Uhhh,’ and Ru was, like, ‘Let’s go to Kinko’s! Let’s make posters of me!’ ”",
            "The early performances could be political, and often framed drag as liberation from oppressive norms. He opened one show, at the Pyramid Club, as a slave on a plantation. “I hate being a slave,” he said, in a breathy, Marilyn Monroe stage whisper. Then he rose to his feet, swimming in mismatched oversized layers of leopard print, crimped hair wild, intoning in a baritone, “I’m a slave. And you’re a slave. And we’re just gonna break out.”",
            "He put himself in front of cameras whenever he could; once, he wrote to an Atlanta public-access variety program called “The American Music Show” and insisted that, since he would soon be a star, he should be booked as a guest. The hosts of the program had never had anyone write to them before. RuPaul soon became a regular. With friends, including Lady Bunny, he made micro-budget short films on Super 8, among them the sexed-up slasher “Trilogy of Terror,” based on the anthology starring Karen Black. Another series of shorts, “Starbooty,” followed, with RuPaul playing a model turned spy in the mold of blaxploitation divas like Cleopatra Jones, reinterpreted in his “Mad Max” aesthetic. “Really, it was just an excuse to change clothes,” Jon Witherspoon, the director of “Starbooty,” later recalled.",
            "In the mid-eighties, when RuPaul was making frequent trips between Atlanta and New York, he met Barbato and Fenton Bailey, who were in a pop act called the Fabulous Pop Tarts but had aspirations to be filmmakers. They have different memories of the first encounter. Bailey told me that he was in a car in Atlanta, and, turning a corner, was confronted by an indelible image: “in the headlights of the car, there was this extraordinary creature pasting these posters.” Barbato recalled meeting him in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis, in Times Square. “He had football shoulder pads on, thigh-high waders, you know, rubber wading boots, and he was dressed like such a freak,” Barbato said. “And it was like seeing a huge star. I was dazzled.”",
            "RuPaul spent Memorial Day of 1986 with Barbato and Bailey in a studio in Manhattan, recording an album built around the “Starbooty” character. “Ru always, always had specific ideas of ‘I want this to sound like that,’ like, he knew music so well,” Barbato said. (“The House of Hidden Meanings” is, among other things, a love letter to RuPaul’s musical inspirations—the songs referenced throughout make up a playlist of about six hours, with cuts of classic rock, disco, and nineties R. & B.) A few years after “Starbooty,” Barbato directed the music video for “Supermodel,” which featured RuPaul vamping around New York, chanting “Sashay, shanté,” before having a slapstick nervous breakdown, replete with snarling and wig-snatching. The song reached No. 1 on Billboard’s dance singles chart, and the video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for best dance video. (It lost to En Vogue’s “Free Your Mind.”)",
            "RuPaul’s earliest collaborations with Barbato and Bailey are among their most winning. For Channel 4, in the U.K., the trio worked on a gonzo cable-news series titled “Manhattan Cable.” RuPaul served as a field correspondent. In one segment, he walked around downtown Manhattan, like Dan Rather in a faux-cheetah coat and platform heels, collecting the stories of sex workers. “The meat market is filled with transvestite hookers by night,” RuPaul tells the camera. And then, with a figurative wink: “Maybe I’ll make my rent money.” His exchanges with the sex workers are frank and sensitive. He likes them, and they seem to like him. As a punch line, he gets into a client’s car and drives off.",
            "The team has continued to build projects around RuPaul ever since. After experiments in different genres—“The RuPaul Show,” a talk show he hosted in full drag, ran on VH1 for a hundred episodes from 1996 to 1998—in the early aughts they devised, with another producer, Tom Campbell, the idea that would become “Drag Race.” RuPaul was initially reluctant. “There was the meeting where Ru was, like, I’ll do anything but a reality competition show,” Bailey told me. But eventually he was won over. “Drag was perceived as some crazy novelty,” Barbato said. “Ru understood having the familiarity of a competition format would help us give something familiar to the networks.” Every platform they pitched passed on the show, except for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ channel Logo TV, where “Drag Race” ran for eight seasons, becoming the network’s most watched program, before moving to VH1 and then to MTV.",
            "As RuPaul became more popular, he changed his look to a less challenging aesthetic that he refers to as “high-femme Glamazon.” He writes about the first time he performed in a more feminine costume, at a wedding-themed drag show, where he wore a white strapless dress with a Dior-style cinched waist. He felt “some energy shift . . . I was finally getting sexual attention.” The early forays into aggressive femininity represented his “Black-hooker phase,” he told me. “I don’t know if that’s politically correct . . . but that was my look. It was like a ‘Soul Train’ dancer.” By the time of “Supermodel,” however, he was moving away from such overt sexuality. The décolletage was becoming more modest, the gowns more polished. “I desexualized all the way,” he told me. The change was not universally welcomed. It “caused a bit of a tiff from the other drag queens who he’d come up with in New York. They kind of labelled it as ‘RuPaul goes to the mall.’ They were all angry,” Jimmy Harry, who co-wrote “Supermodel,” once said. “But I think that was necessary for him to kind of become a commercial entity.”",
            "RuPaul’s rise has made him a target for criticism within the queer community. In an interview with the Guardian, in 2018, he wondered whether physically transitioned transgender women should compete on the show. “Probably not,” he said. “It takes on a different thing; it changes the whole concept of what we’re doing.” The show has long featured transgender competitors, but early seasons were dominated by those who identified as gay, male, and cisgender. Gia Gunn, a contestant, told New York, “There were trans women who were putting their transitions on hold and purposely not taking hormones leading up to the show.” Another contestant, Monica Beverly Hillz, told the queer Web site Them that, after a struggle to fund her transition through sex work, “Drag Race helped me escape that world, but their world was never really made for me either.” More recent seasons have had transgender winners, including Kylie Sonique Love, Willow Pill, and Sasha Colby. “I didn’t have a single issue,” Jinkx Monsoon, who identified as transfemme during her most recent win on the show, told me. “Every season, it becomes more and more mindful of what’s going on in the actual drag world. . . . People want to call Ru transphobic. And I just think that’s really hard for me to believe, given Ru’s history.” In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” RuPaul describes a life in drag entwined with trans performers, a community he speaks of with apparent affection. But he has built a career on sidestepping gender norms in a way that involves ignoring identity labels, which can be in tension with contemporary discourse. He doesn’t much like to talk about the issue. “Gender is a concept that we come up with, in our minds and our egos,” he told me. “My genitals are male. But I can be whatever I can. I feel I’m everything. You are everything. You are male, female. Sometimes I feel more male than others.”",
            "Criticism also followed an interview with NPR, in 2020, in which he suggested that fracking, an environmentally destructive practice used to extract fossil fuels, was taking place on his husband’s Wyoming ranch. RuPaul remains defiantly annoyed about the matter. “Do you buy gas?” he said to me. “Before you point the finger, smell it first, bitch.” He sounds weary when discussing these controversies. “There’s no combination of words I can put together that would soothe the mob,” he said.",
            "Sam Lansky, a writer who helped RuPaul with “The House of Hidden Meanings,” told me, “He has been, in some ways, sort of misread in terms of his beliefs, or his politics,” contributing to “a world-weariness that he has, and this kind of pessimism that everything is gonna go bad.”",
            "In the memoir, RuPaul treats most celebrities he’s encountered with diplomacy, if not reverence. An exception is Madonna, whom he describes giving him a “snarl of contempt” at a club in the eighties. “In aging, there is a natural flow,” he told me. “And, when you’re against the flow, it doesn’t look right, it doesn’t feel right. The energy around the Madonna thing—it feels weird, right?” He referred to “chasing arena tours and grills in your teeth.” He added, “I’m not interested in appealing to eleven-to-twenty-five-year-olds, I’m just not. I can, on a bigger level, as a mother. As Mama Ru. It’s a different relationship—I’m not trying to be them.”",
            "At Pinewood, RuPaul emerged from a bathroom, decked out for a non-drag segment of the show in a Trina Turk suit with a swirling, psychedelic maroon print. Thairin Smothers, one of his producers, handed him a paper cup of hot water with lemon, then followed him into a TV studio. Under fuchsia lights, a set for “Snatch Game,” a sendup of “Match Game,” awaited. In the segment, a staple of “Drag Race,” a panel of contestants, each impersonating a celebrity, attempts to complete a phrase, trying to match answers provided by celebrity guests. The episode’s guests were Rachel Stevens and John Lee, of the pop group S Club. Opposite them sat drag renditions of Elvis Presley, Liza Minnelli, Marie Antoinette, a dragon, and other characters. RuPaul, cue cards in hand, set them up for witty comebacks to questions.",
            "This was a light makeup day: for non-drag segments, RuPaul applies his own eyebrows, using four different products. Raven, the makeup artist, was nevertheless watching the monitors in case touch-ups were needed. She told me that she had worked with RuPaul on seven seasons of television in 2023 alone. “I literally fill a suitcase, go home, fill another suitcase, go again,” she said. Smothers corrected her. “Lingo,” a game show on CBS that RuPaul began hosting last year, had made a season, too. “It all kind of blends together after seventeen years,” Smothers said, watching the monitors. Many of the “Drag Race” staff have worked on the show for a decade or more. For all RuPaul’s boundary-setting, the atmosphere can be unusually familial for TV. Under the lights at Pinewood, the queen playing Liza Minnelli tried out an old standard, snapping, “I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” and RuPaul howled with laughter.",
            "A few days later, RuPaul woke up and performed his morning ritual. First, he stretched. “I’m older,” he said. “I have to make sure everything is doing the thing.” Then he prayed, saying aloud the words “Dear God, thank you,” followed by things for which he is grateful. That week, the list included the roof over his head, his access to running water, and Georges, his husband, whom he met while dancing at Limelight, in New York, in the nineties. After that, he meditated, a practice that can last anywhere from forty-five seconds to fifteen minutes. He lets the ideas drift through: “Oh, there’s my father. Oh, there’s Judy Garland.” His demons are there, too, but he claims to have befriended them. He put on another black hoodie and another pair of black workout pants and walked ten minutes to the nearest Marks & Spencer to pick up an apple turnover.",
            "Soon afterward, we sat in the living room of his rental cottage, a modest, two-story structure with neutral walls and a tiny kitchenette to which he had added, as far as I could tell, nothing but a row of identical boxes of berry-flavored Special K. “I brought this in,” he said, pointing to an LCD monitor that sat, with his laptop, on an otherwise empty white desk. “And I moved this chair. That’s about it.” Yet he was crazy about the place—he liked the flow of the floor plan, and took pictures of it, to try to replicate it in Wyoming.",
            "RuPaul is, in profound ways, a loner. For much of his adult life, he had felt alienated from the easy intimacy of casual gay sex. “In my twenties and stuff, when I was meeting someone at a bar or something, I always would want to find some type of connection, but it was not there,” he said. “And I did not enjoy being with somebody I don’t have a connection to.”",
            "His Black identity didn’t furnish much sense of community, either. “I come from a Black family,” he said. “But I always felt different. Not better or anything. I just felt like Ru.” In the memoir, he recounts a moment, two years after his move to Atlanta, when his father grilled him about rumors that he was having gay sex. “In the Black church, ‘gay’ represents something against the family, and the family is an extension of how Black people survived from slavery,” he told me. “So my existence becomes a threat to the family, because I’m other than.” I expected that he would suggest that he now relishes his role as a trailblazing celebrity in the Black community. “I’ve won fourteen Emmys. And you would think I’d have been on the cover of Ebony, if that still exists,” he said. “I don’t represent what the Black community wants to lift up. I never have.” His computer’s desktop showed a black-and-white closeup of Diana Ross. From an early age, he admired her ability to craft an image that was unthreatening to white audiences. “I went, That’s what I want to do. I want to be on a world stage and not be questioned, or make people feel threatened,” he said. “Most Black people in our culture have to not scare white folks.”",
            "RuPaul told me that his social life is circumscribed, in some ways, by design. “I meet new people, but like, socially, do I go out to dinner with people, or meet someone and say, ‘Hey, let’s go on a hike’? Very rarely.” He and his husband have an open relationship. “It’s just realistic,” he said. “There’s no such thing as monogamy with men.” But, he said, because of his fame, there’s no longer “a circle of people that I can sort of rely on” for intimacy.",
            "When Georges and he first met, Georges asked if he could floss RuPaul’s teeth. RuPaul, horrified, said no. But Georges eventually got past his guardedness. While I was with RuPaul, Georges FaceTimed him from a hospital room, where he was recovering from a minor medical procedure. “Oh, my God, look at you,” RuPaul said. “Did you get the morphine I told you to get?” And then: “I love you.” At one point, while we were talking, RuPaul mentioned his name, smiled, and then started to cry.",
            "“I would love to have more fun,” he told me. “I would love to go to a fucking roller disco. Why aren’t there fucking roller discos? What’s the deal? People have lost track of what’s really fun.” RuPaul has his own skates, and he’s nimble. Occasionally, he will drive to a remote parking lot and skate by himself. But he finds the kind of night life he once loved to be inaccessible. “You know, at a night club or at a disco dance place, people are on their phones,” he said. “How am I going to be spiritual and in the moment, sweating, and take my shirt off, where there are people filming?”",
            "Lansky, the writer, described to me what he thought of as RuPaul’s foundational beliefs: “Don’t take anything too seriously. Don’t treat anything as sacred. Stay in play, nurture your inner child.” For all its profitability, “Drag Race” still ropes contestants into campy, small-budget music-video shoots that mirror his own experiments on “The American Music Show,” in Atlanta: creations with little artistry and lots of cheap wigs and improv. Before he dropped out of high school, a drama teacher scolded him for caring about his precarious academic career, telling him, “RuPaul, don’t take life too fucking seriously.” The admonition has since become a mantra. “I’m always looking to play,” he said. “I want to be in that state all the time.”",
            "RuPaul has been sober since the late nineties. In “The House of Hidden Meanings,” he describes years of alcohol abuse that he now views as an effort to “anesthetize” himself, and also his eventual decision to seek treatment, spurred by his effort to help Georges, who was addicted to crystal meth. But he remains a proponent of psychedelics, and told me that early acid trips provided essential perspective on the importance of being in a state of play. “That’s why hallucinogens are so wonderful. Because your self-consciousness is stripped away when you’re tripping your balls,” he said. The spiritual guru he finds most influential, he said, is “my fucking idol, Bugs Bunny. Who is a fucking Zen master.” His teachings: “Don’t take other people too serious. And stay ahead of their stupidity. If you have to, build a fucking compound somewhere, but stay ahead of their own self-destructive, ridiculous mentality.”",
            "RuPaul has been trying to outrun that kind of thinking for a long time. He recalled an appearance he made, in full drag, on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” in 1993—a radical act, at the time. “In the moment, on ‘Arsenio Hall,’ I’m up against the status quo and the machine,” he recalled. “There is pain in that.”",
            "He got up and served me the apple turnover. With his face shadowed by the hoodie and bare of makeup, he looked ascetic and almost otherworldly. He told me he’d been reflecting on his comment about not liking kids. “I would be a great parent,” he said. Though he would fear sending a child into a world he finds inhospitable and dangerous, he added, “I would love that kid so much.” The cottage is near a school. “The bell just rang,” he said. “You know, last year, when I took this place, I thought, Oh, God, the kids, they’re gonna drive me crazy.” Now, he told me, “I fucking love hearing their voices out there. It’s kind of this white noise of joy.” ♦",

            "[The husband-and-wife filmmakers discuss “Drive-Away Dolls,” untraditional marriage, and their planned lesbian trilogy.]",
            "Few things are more comedically satisfying than an odd-couple pairing. Oscar and Felix, Lucy and Ethel, Tom Wambsgans and Cousin Greg: if the tensions are plentiful, so are the laffs. In “Drive-Away Dolls,” the new caper from the married couple Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, we have Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), two lesbian friends, in 1999, who can’t avoid rubbing each other the wrong way. Jamie is a Texan live wire, all twang and sexual bravado, and Marian is a guarded Henry James reader in a pussy-bow blouse. When Jamie’s girlfriend, Sukie (Beanie Feldstein), tosses her out of the house for cheating, Jamie joins Marian on a trip from Philadelphia to Tallahassee, and the two find themselves in the midst of a complicated scheme involving a severed head, assorted dildos, a crooked conservative senator, and a mysterious briefcase.",
            "“Ethan thinks I’m like Jamie,” Cooke said on a Zoom call the other day, from a wooden-raftered Airbnb in Albuquerque, where the couple are shooting another movie. “I’m a glass-half-full person. Ethan can kind of spiral into—”",
            "“I’m like Marian,” Coen interjected. He had a close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard and wore black-rimmed glasses. “I’m the worrier.” He sighed. “Sometimes I get infuriated with Trish for not worrying!”",
            "“I admit I can be a little cavalier,” Cooke conceded. She had on black-rimmed glasses like her husband’s, and her brown hair fell straight down her back.",
            "“Me, on the other hand, all I’ve got are my fears!” Coen said.",
            "When casting “Drive-Away Dolls,” the couple quickly found their Marian in Viswanathan. It was harder to find a Jamie—“someone who is charismatic and reckless but then can turn sweet very easily,” Cooke said. Qualley was a last-minute addition. “Before you find the person, it’s an enormous locus of anxiety for me,” Coen said. He considered “No Country for Old Men,” the Oscar-winning movie, from 2007, that he made with his brother, Joel, and said, “The most anxious part of my life was until we cast Josh Brolin, and that was just three weeks before we had to start shooting. I was, like, ‘We’re fucked.’ ”",
            "For the past four decades, Ethan has worked with Joel on a slew of movies that examine man’s darkly violent impulses through an absurdist lens. After “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” was released, in 2018, Ethan decided to take a break. “He kind of semi-retired,” Cooke said.",
            "A couple of years later, however, during the pandemic, he dipped his toe in again, by co-directing, with Cooke, a documentary, “Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind,” which came out in 2022. “We had a lot of fun working on it together,” Cooke said. As an editor, she has cut many of the Coens’ movies, including “The Big Lebowski” and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” The enforced hiatus of covid also prodded them to dig up a script they’d written in the early two-thousands. They decided to rewrite it. It was originally titled “Drive-Away Dykes.”",
            "“Me and Ethan met on a movie in 1989, in New Orleans, and we were very close friends, best friends, for years,” Cooke said. “I’d come out in college, and I identified as a lesbian.”",
            "“I come from Minneapolis, where there are no lesbians!” Coen said. “So, this was all new and exciting to me.”",
            "Cooke laughed. “At some point, I was, like, This is silly. He’s the person I want to spend all my time with. So, we made that work. And still do.”",
            "They’ve been married since 1993, have two grown children, and live together, but their relationship is open. “I felt like I was losing my lesbian identity, and we were, like, O.K., let’s change our marriage to make it work,” Cooke said.",
            "“It wasn’t vexed or problematic,” Coen said. “We kind of fell into it, and it seemed natural.”",
            "“Drive-Away Dolls” is the first of a projected lesbian trilogy. The second installment, a detective genre piece titled “Honey Don’t!,” is the project that brought them to New Mexico. Although it’s more noir than comedy, they want it to retain the feel of a B movie. “The world is a rough place,” Cooke said. “And I do a lot of political-activism work, so, for me, to tell stories that are a little bit silly or trashy or stupid, it’s just a sigh of relief.”",
            "The silliness is still a lot of work. “Ethan is always working,” Cooke went on. She turned to her husband. “There’s never a spare minute in your day.”",
            "“That’s actually not true,” he protested, not too convincingly. (This past summer, he wrote a new screenplay with his brother.) “I sit around looking into space most of the time.”",
            "“It’s the life of the mind!” Cooke said.",
            "“O.K., we’ll call it that!” Coen said. ♦",

            "[The paper championed a new style of journalism at a time when the persistence of silence and constraint was more plausibly imagined than a world awash in personal truths.]",
            "Naturally, a moment matters. In this case, a moment that was also, and might be considered still, a place: fixed, discernable, real. A community already dreaming of itself as a site of ferment and change, already wishing to stay the same. The idea was to capture and reflect something of this moment, this place, but also to capitalize, to fill a perceived void with what was presumed to be lacking. It being 1955, in New York City, a newspaper was the thing—one fashioned by and for the self-styled bohemians of Greenwich Village, a neighborhood of nearly two hundred square, trapezoidal, and triangle-shaped blocks in the city’s downtown.",
            "Founded by three veterans of the Second World War with zero journalistic or publishing experience, this paper would conjure its authority by other than the usual means. A sort of conjured authority, the men suspected—they were all men, and all white—might suit their market well. Tabloid in form, the paper would be printed weekly, chronicling, but also manifesting, with each issue the context from which it sprang. A context of questioning, confluence, independent thought, advocacy, a personal eye (and “I”) turned on matters of every kind, but mostly those too local or unusual to bear mention in the newspaper of record, headquartered uptown. They decided to call their publication the Village Voice, despite its rejection of that uptown paper’s univocality, and its mandate, in fact, of the opposite: of voices, voices everywhere.",
            "The founders—a fledgling psychologist named Ed Fancher, the pseudoliterary Rotarian Dan Wolf, and Norman Mailer, who provided fifteen thousand dollars, a short-lived column, and not much more—believed that time would clarify the nature and viability of their experiment, and time did, across a moment that comprised more than six decades, at least eight owners, and at least one mass-extinction event. When the latest of its publishers, the multibillionaire retail heir Peter Barbey, shuttered the Voice, in 2018, a Times article quoted a lament from the journalist Tom Robbins, one of the many marquee personalities who, through their decades-long association with the paper, became synonymous with its brand. “It’s astonishing that this is happening in New York,” Robbins said, “the biggest media town in America.” That second part struck a wistful tone even then, a year when social media added nearly a million new users every day and the global population was projected to spend a combined billion years online. By the time the Voice had assumed its current semi-undead form, following a 2020 resurrection, the creeping irrelevance of any bounded and singular context—including that of a town, much less “the biggest media town in America”—had become the kind of thing a person might fail to notice while engaged in the ruthless business of noticing everything else.",
            "Those outlets now referred to as “legacy media” have survived in part by adopting elements first innovated by the Voice, which, in its coverage of beats ranging from City Hall and CBGB to the odd foreign revolution, demonstrated a radical embrace of the subjective, a prizing of argument and opinion, of lived experience over expertise. Determined to both maintain and eat away at its own boundaries, it became a critical, journalistic, and publishing titan, a context unto itself. In the opening pages of “The Freaks Came Out to Write,” Tricia Romano’s new and raucous oral history of the paper, Howard Blum, a former staff writer, is the first to declare the Voice “a precursor to the internet,” an idea that recurs, with diminishing shine, throughout the book’s five hundred and thirty pages. Notes of elegy sound throughout, laments for something too good to last, but also for a moment of honest and urgent revolt. When there seemed no such thing as too many voices, or an excess of subjectivity—when, on and off the page, the persistence of silence and constraint were far more plausibly imagined than a world awash in personal truths.",
            "Structured in short, chronologically ordered chapters, “The Freaks Came Out to Write” unfolds like the kind of epic, many-roomed party that invokes the spirit of other parties and their immortal ghosts. Romano escorts the reader from room to room, where a set of relevant players hold forth on the subject at hand. Here are Michael Smith and Lucian K. Truscott IV, hashing out how a line about the “forces of faggotry” made it into the latter’s firsthand account of the 1969 Stonewall protests. Over there, Vivian Gornick, Ellen Willis, and Susan Brownmiller discuss the double bind of writing about women’s issues for a paper that afforded them, in Gornick’s words, “the most astonishing amount of space and time,” despite a workplace blighted by what the critic Laurie Stone elsewhere calls “ordinary, old-school, male fuckheads.” The sort of men who would publish a letter like the one written by James Wolcott, who would later become a staff writer, belittling her 1971 piece “On Goosing,” about being sexually accosted in public. “God help us if she ever gets raped,” Wolcott wrote. “We will be buried under an avalanche of rhetoric.”",
            "Romano’s book is designed to abet a case for the Voice as a kind of nexus of twentieth-century incident, and most chapters offer an inside history of familiar events. We learn how the reporting of a local activist named Mary Perot Nichols helped defeat Robert Moses’s plan to build various highways across lower Manhattan; how an early profile of Spike Lee (instigated by Lee himself) led to funding for “She’s Gotta Have It,” his breakout film; how Wayne Barrett’s 1979 exposé of Donald Trump’s business dealings raised an alarm that would clatter for decades to come. Occasionally, this fervent dot-connecting grows strained, as in a chapter that intersects the Voice with graffiti culture, breakdancing, and the emergence of Jean-Michel Basquiat. But the over-all effect echoes the former editor-in-chief Karen Durbin’s conception of the Voice as “a great bar in the Village, a funky bar,” full of gossip, squabbling, and well-earned nostalgia. The longing is for a lost paradise of synergy and shared purpose, a season of what Guy Trebay describes as a “porosity” between worlds, when an eclectic staff, their subjects, and a growing legion of readers agreed on a core set of interests and values. “We all said some stupid things,” the longtime Voice movie critic Andrew Sarris says, of the savage feuding among his colleagues. “But film seemed to matter so much.”",
            "Romano, who covered the New York club scene during her eight years at the Voice, amassed her cast of characters from a combination of archival research and more than two hundred original interviews. Effectively a work of collage, the oral history must find unity through arrangement and juxtaposition, the recontextualizing of untethered quotes. Billed in its subtitle as “the definitive history” of “the radical paper that changed American culture,” “The Freaks Came Out to Write,” in foregrounding the disparate perspectives of its writers and editors, proposes paradox and contradiction as two of the Voice’s operating principles. Certainly an entrenched antagonism between the so-called whiteboys—gumshoe journalists who occupied the front of the book, including Barrett, Jack Newfield, and Nat Hentoff—and the nonwhite, queer, and women writers who dominated the culture and review sections seems to have powered the paper’s function and dysfunction alike. Residue of that bitterness clings to this history, outlasting many of the players in question.",
            "Writers also dish on their favorite editors (Marianne Partridge, the paper’s first female editor-in-chief, was beloved by reporters; David Schneiderman slowly won the hearts of those who held his Times pedigree in contempt), the peak era (the sixties; no, the nineties; perhaps the decades in between), when and why it all seemed to go wrong (usually when someone sold the paper for a whopping sum, beginning with the multimillion-dollar payout to Wolf and Fancher, in 1970). True to form, mostly the writers talk about themselves, and one another: Harry Allen riffs on Greg Tate’s “rabidly combinatorial” critical voice; Paul Berman describes the British media critic Alexander Cockburn as “a brilliant stylist in a certain limited way,” producer of a “marvelous column if you ignore what he actually said in it.” Consensus forms around a culture of indulgence: “There was nothing that the Voice wouldn’t let you do”; “We never used one word when seventeen would do.” Brownmiller once counted the number of times “I” appeared in someone’s story. “You would think that they were the internet,” Gornick says. “They let us go on and on and on.”",
            "The reader is left to wonder at the idea of Rupert Murdoch, who owned the Voice from 1977 to 1985, overseeing an era of prosperity and relative calm at a paper that by then had found a sweet spot between staying true to its outsider image and the successful retail of same. As long as the paper made money, it seems, Murdoch would tolerate even the constant attacks on him within its folds. The business side gets scant treatment in these pages; we learn of readership surges during the 1962-63 New York City newspaper strike and another across the latter half of that decade (when circulation grew to exceed that of of ninety-five per cent of American big-city dailies), but the paper’s economic systems remain largely obscure.",
            "Until, that is, those systems come to dominate the story, beginning with the decision, in 1996, to make the Voice free, available around town in “urine-soaked boxes,” what the former editor-in-chief David Blum calls “the most disgusting distribution model I’ve ever seen in my entire life.” Then comes Craigslist, a series of sales to investor groups and media conglomerates, a scandal involving “adult services” ads and allegations of sex trafficking, and a lingering question about whether it all could have gone otherwise—if the Voice could have survived the erasure of the moment that defined it as an alternative, a thing apart from other things. Though aspects of its style and attitude have scaled uncommonly well, the paper’s success depended at least as much on its relationship to a fruitful context, a thing of scant value in a culture that mostly refers to itself.",
            "Often, these days, I find myself in conversation with students seeking advice not about how or what to write but where to try and publish the thing they haven’t yet written. These students tend to be in transition, mid-pivot, escaping or avoiding work in one of the industries now described as a “space,” despite lacking much that qualifies as fixed, discernable, real. Confronted with this question, I always counter with one of my own—“What are you reading?”—in part because it was how I and every writer I know first set about attaching our blobby ambitions to an actual goal. It’s true that they can’t, or at least don’t, mention the Village Voice, in which I published almost two hundred and fifty reviews and stories over nine years, and which helped pay my rent as a writer new to the city. (In its current online incarnation, the Voice can feel like it exists mostly as a host to its vast archives; newly published stories appear on the home page, but the rest of the site’s various sections favor a selection of older pieces.) But you would not know, from the mild affront and confusion with which students greet my question—as though I had inquired after some unknowable data set, like the exact date and time of their deaths—that other publications do indeed still exist.",
            "A familiar gulf opens between student and professor, then, one I have come to regard with more tenderness than annoyance. What my students seek is what I sought: not just a place to publish, of which there remain plenty, but a place to aspire to, the kind of established, vital ecosystem within which a writer can learn, play, feud, create meaning, spark conversation, make sense of herself and her world. Rare by definition, such things grow more elusive by the day. The legacy of the Voice resides in its embodiment of a time when publishing a neighborhood paper that would reflect for its readers, as Ed Fancher put it, “the intellectual and artistic firmament” of their community could matter as much as it turned out to do. ♦"

In “The Look of Love,” Morris, more often associated with Baroque music, responds to the familiar melodies of Burt Bacharach. (Even Kermit the Frog has sung “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head.”) The songs, adapted by Ethan Iverson for jazz ensemble and the vocalist Marcy Harriell, speak of life’s foibles with an earnestness that Morris both channels and subverts, with a suite performed by his wonderfully down-to-earth dancers. Loneliness and pain keep peeking through the friendly veneer—but hope remains.",
            "Seven years after Trisha Brown’s death, the Trisha Brown Dance Company soldiers on, and lately it has begun commissioning new work. “In the Fall” is the second such creation; Noé Soulier, its choreographer, is based in France, where the influence of Brown’s momentum-driven, lucid dances has loomed large. At the Joyce (March 26-31), Soulier’s piece is performed alongside “Glacial Decoy” (1979), a beautiful, spare work by Brown in which luminous dancers clad in white pleated dresses move, with loose-limbed elegance, in front of black-and-white images of everyday places. (The set and costume designs are by Robert Rauschenberg.)",
            "The following month, the Joyce shines a light on the work of the jazz innovator Max Roach, born a hundred years ago, with a program of dances, in “Max Roach 100” (April 2-7). Inspired by the drummer’s flexible, almost pointillist use of rhythm, three choreographers, working in different modes, take on Roach’s catalogue. Ronald K. Brown has made a fluid West African-influenced piece for an ensemble of Cuban and American dancers, set to Roach’s 1961 Afro-Cuban album, “Percussion Bitter Sweet.” Rennie Harris applies his sophisticated brand of hip-hop to Roach’s “The Dream/It’s Time,” which contains a dialogue between percussion and Martin Luther King’s voice. And, in a twenty-minute solo, Ayodele Casel, a tap choreographer with a rhythmic and sonic range to rival Roach’s, riffs on a series of duets that Roach recorded with the pianist Cecil Taylor, in 1979.",
            "The Martha Graham Dance Company celebrates its centenary a little early—Graham’s first choreographic evening wasn’t until 1926—with revivals of classic dances by Graham and Agnes de Mille, plus a new commission (City Center; April 17-20). The most classic of all is Graham’s “Appalachian Spring,” from 1944, whose choreography, music (by Aaron Copland), and set (by Isamu Noguchi) have come to represent a certain idea of the spaciousness of the West. Another of Copland’s evocations of America, “Rodeo,” has been adapted for bluegrass ensemble, to accompany a restaging of de Mille’s ballet of the same name. (Graham and de Mille were not only contemporaries but close friends.) The young choreographer Jamar Roberts, lately of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, creates his first dance for the company, set to a folk-and-gospel score by Rhiannon Giddens, a vocal artist with a knack for reinvention.—Marina Harss",

            "The theme of this year’s Whitney Biennial (opening March 20), entitled “Even Better Than the Real Thing,” splits the difference between the topical and the timeless. The co-curators Chrissie Iles and Meg Onli say they have emphasized art that explores shifting definitions of reality—also known as all art, you might argue, though the reality of the twenty-twenties has fluctuated like the price of cryptocurrency and seems particularly in need of artists who can make sense of it. There are sixty-nine of them (plus two collectives) in the new installment.",
            "The early-twentieth-century German artist Käthe Kollwitz devoted her life to expressing “the sufferings of men,” and her Expressionist prints and drawings are as sombre as that pledge makes them sound. But they’re also joyfully inventive in their depictions of weavers, soldiers, and struggling mothers, and together they constitute something close to a history of their maker’s country in its darkest decades. For Kollwitz’s first major exhibition at a New York museum (March 31), MOMA has assembled roughly a hundred and twenty works, the better to make a full-throated case for her importance to art, politics, and political art.",
            "With “Hiroshige’s 100 Famous Views of Edo (feat. Takashi Murakami)” (April 5), the Brooklyn Museum is showing one of the most glittery treasures in its permanent collection for the first time in nearly a quarter century. Hiroshige’s series of woodblock prints—produced in the years leading up to his death, in 1858, and thereafter completed by his apprentice, Hiroshige II—is inaccurately named: there are a hundred and eighteen views in all. Considering that “Views” has a claim to being the single greatest creation of the single greatest Japanese artist, however, showing more than advertised doesn’t seem like a bad thing. An accompanying set of Takashi Murakami paintings riffs on the prints’ calm with madcap Surrealism.",
            "The Native American artist Rose B. Simpson is having a good year. Her work appears in the Whitney Biennial, and for the twentieth anniversary of the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s public-art program she has contributed a set of figurative sculptures in steel and bronze; while these occupy Madison Square Park, two others will be on view in Inwood Hill Park. The second location wasn’t lightly chosen. It’s believed to be the site where Dutch settlers “bought” the island of Manhattan from the Lenape tribe, for next to nothing—a sour truth that gives this two-part outdoor exhibition, “Seed” (April 11), a tone that is both outraged and triumphant.",
            "Frederick Kiesler was a mutant creature of the early twentieth century: an experimental designer who was also an artist who was also an inventor, writer, architect, professor, and all-round charismatically wacky visionary. The Jewish Museum’s exhibition “Frederick Kiesler: Vision Machines” (April 25) examines his tenure as the director of the Laboratory for Design Correlation, at Columbia University, during which he pursued projects such as the Mobile Home Library, a rotating-shelf device that has been constructed specially for this occasion, close to a century after he dreamed it up.",

            "Thirty-five years ago, the inner wall of the Guggenheim Museum was dressed in curling ribbons of L.E.D. lights. The dresser, Jenny Holzer, has spent her career composing koan-like phrases and turning them into signs that lurk in museums and public places, waiting to pounce. In “Jenny Holzer: Light Line” (Guggenheim; May 17), a reimagining of the earlier show, she brings back her old words and adds new ones, some generated by artificial intelligence. A natural response to all this may well be confusion, but, as the artist herself tells us, “CONFUSING YOURSELF IS A WAY TO STAY HONEST.”—Jackson Arn",

            "The Miró Quartet’s brief survey of twentieth- and twenty-first-century American art music, at the Church of the Intercession, in Harlem (May 4), adopts a tenderly elegiac tone, with famed string pieces by George Walker and Samuel Barber. Other ensembles fill in that history with missing voices. At Town Hall, Kronos Quartet and Ghost Train Orchestra delve into the extensive catalogue of Moondog (April 16), a blind composer of simple, catchy songs, who was known as the “viking of Sixth Avenue” for the horned helmet and cloak that he wore on the streets of New York in the fifties and sixties. For the centenary of the Black composer Julia Perry’s birth, the Experiential Orchestra mounts a four-day festival, which closes at Alice Tully Hall with Perry’s aching Prelude for Strings and her piquant Violin Concerto (March 16).",
            "John Adams’s “El Niño,” a Nativity oratorio that humanizes Mary’s experience of motherhood, has its Metropolitan Opera première (select dates April 23-May 17). Dan Schlosberg and Amanda Quaid’s “The Extinctionist,” in Heartbeat Opera’s first world première, also contends with a birth: a woman wrestles with the moral dilemma of bringing a child into a world that appears to be falling apart as a result of global warming (Baruch Performing Arts Center; select dates April 2-14).",
            "The director Peter Sellars, whose work is both visionary and humane, likewise concerns himself with climate collapse in “Shall We Gather at the River,” an original show that weaves together spirituals and Bach cantatas, at the Park Avenue Armory (May 21); the cast includes the smooth-voiced countertenor Reginald Mobley. Bach crisscrosses with the modern era in two programs: one by the pianist Simone Dinnerstein, who pairs his lilting sinfonias with music by Keith Jarrett and Philip Lasser, at Miller Theatre (April 25), and the other by the cellist Alisa Weilerstein, who couches Zoltán Kodály’s twisting Sonata for Solo Cello among Bach cello suites, at the 92nd Street Y, New York (April 3).",
            "The Danish String Quartet presents the fourth installment of its “Doppelgänger” series, which pairs a Schubert work with a new commission, this time by the ever-interesting Thomas Adès (April 18), at Carnegie Hall. Paul Lewis, a Schubert interpreter of verve and fluidity, offers his own four-part cycle of the composer’s work—specifically, the piano sonatas—for Peoples’ Symphony Concerts, where tickets cost less than ten dollars with a subscription (various venues; April 27 and May 19).",
            "Also at Carnegie, the American Symphony Orchestra tackles Schoenberg’s “Gurre-Lieder,” a last, magnificent gasp of post-Romanticism in the composer’s œuvre, for the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of his birth (March 22). Mitsuko Uchida, a pianist of engrossingly precise insight, centers her “Perspectives” series on her lodestars Mozart (March 28) and Schubert (April 9). The baritone Matthias Goerne wraps a voice of dark velvet around Schumann’s “Dichterliebe” (April 25), and the sensitive pianist Jan Lisiecki plays Chopin’s Twenty-Four Preludes for his recital début on Carnegie’s main stage (March 13).",

The movie is written and directed by John Ridley; Lance Reddick and Terrence Howard co-star.

            "Much of life’s most important action takes the form of talk, but Hollywood sees things differently and, as usual, will be filling the screen with rough-and-tumble adventure in a range of genres. “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” (March 22), the franchise’s latest sequel, directed by Gil Kenan, combines members of the first-generation poltergeist patrol (including Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, and Bill Murray) with newcomers (Carrie Coon, Celeste O’Connor, Paul Rudd) who attempt to prevent a new ice age. Alex Garland’s dystopian fantasy “Civil War” (April 12) stars Kirsten Dunst as a journalist covering the violence of a second American civil war involving the secession of Texas and California; Nick Offerman plays the President. “The Fall Guy” (May 3), directed by David Leitch, a former stunt coördinator and a co-director of the first “John Wick” movie, is a comic thriller about a stuntman (Ryan Gosling) who hunts for an actor (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) gone missing from a film that his friend (Emily Blunt) is directing. In the sports romance “Challengers” (April 26), Zendaya plays a tennis coach who is training her husband (Mike Faist) prior to his big match against her ex (Josh O’Connor).",
            "American independent filmmaking returns to prominence with a varied slate of movies. One of the hits of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, “Sasquatch Sunset” (April 12), directed by the brothers David and Nathan Zellner, stars Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg as the titular creatures, who make their way across American landscapes. In Bob Byington’s “Lousy Carter” (March 29), David Krumholtz plays a terminally ill literature professor whose professional activities and love life are in chaos. Joanna Arnow wrote and directed “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed” (April 26), a dramedy about a thirtysomething New Yorker (Arnow) who searches for romantic connection and a sexually submissive relationship; it was one of the outstanding entries in last year’s New York Film Festival. Pamela Adlon makes her feature-film directorial début with “Babes” (May 17), starring Ilana Glazer (who co-wrote the script) as a single woman who becomes pregnant and decides to raise the child on her own.",
            "Idiosyncratic offerings are en route from the international cinema, such as “The Beast” (April 5), the French director Bertrand Bonello’s science-fiction spin on a Henry James story of failed romance, “The Beast in the Jungle”; the movie is set in three eras, ranging from the early twentieth century to 2044. The contemporary dystopian tale “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” (March 22), from the Romanian filmmaker Radu Jude, centers on two women named Angela: a production assistant on an industrial-safety video, who is also a social-media provocateur, and a taxi driver who is also the protagonist of a real Romanian movie from 1981. In “La Chimera” (March 29), directed by the Italian filmmaker Alice Rohrwacher, an archeologist haunted by memories of a woman he loved becomes involved with smugglers, whose excavations may open a door to his past.

            "Mr. Biden was first diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2008. The doctor’s notes indicate it could be getting worse.",
            "More than 30 million Americans have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, which can cause sufferers to choke and gasp dozens of times per hour as they sleep. As a person ages, the effects of the disorder often get worse.",
            "A 2022 study found patients with sleep apnea have a 43% higher risk of developing any type of neurocognitive disorder, a 28% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 54% higher risk of Parkinson’s disease.",
            "“People with sleep apnea who spend less time in deep sleep are more likely to have brain health problems that could lead to dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or a stroke, a new study shows,” WebMD wrote in May, citing a Journal of Sleep Research probe published in the medical journal Neurology.",
            "The study compared people with amyloid plaques in the brain, an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. “We found that people with amyloid plaques who had more severe sleep apneas also were more likely to have lower volumes in the medial temporal lobe area of the brain, including the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Geraldine Rauch wrote.",
            "Researchers say the sleep apnea link with dementia is probably caused by the brain being starved of oxygen during sleep, which can damage blood vessels and lead to the development of plaque.",
            "Dr. O’Connor noted that Mr. Biden had difficulty adjusting to the PAP mask. “This is reasonably anticipated and, in fact, should be expected. … But with trials of several different masks, we have been able to identify a couple of products which fit him very comfortably and effectively,” the doctor said.",
            "In addition to sleep apnea, the physical revealed Mr. Biden suffers from an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, which drastically raises the risk of stroke. The president has suffered from the condition since 2003, and Dr. O’Connor says he continues to take the blood thinner apixaban, brand name Eliquis, to treat the heart condition.",

            "Asked if there could be further reductions in the tax announced on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said: “The Chancellor and the UK Government chose to cut national insurance; there were lots of reasons for that, but first and foremost it is a tax on work.",

            "Cosmetic surgery isn’t something that has ever crossed my mind, to be honest with you. I’ve never felt compelled to hand over cash to someone to take a knife to my face or my body with the specific aim of altering it into something that may not resemble the body I’ve grown up with. I don’t, however, have any issues with anyone who does. We all have a different relationship with our bodies: some of us love what our DNA created, but some of us don’t. And, again, both scenarios are okay.",
            "But even as a grown-ass woman who’s fairly confident within herself, on seeing women with incredible bodies, oozing healthy lifestyles on Instagram, I often sigh – because it’s a reminder of what I don’t have body-wise since having two kids in fairly quick succession later on in life. It’s never impacted me enough that I’ll do something drastic about it, but I do have those blips where I look in the mirror and am not particularly over the moon about the body staring back at me. Those moments are rare though – I’m generally cool with what I’ve got.",
            "However, a conversation with a mate this week reminded me of that feeling, when she mentioned that a few of our mutual acquaintances whom we both follow online had, in the past year, gone through waist sculpting surgery and other procedures to alter the look of their body – which explained their newfound confidence on the ‘gram.",

            "I’d been comparing myself to at least two of them for a while. So, and I know it may seem ridiculous, I think I felt slightly betrayed in some way. I suddenly realised that I had occasionally been viewing my own body unfavourably because I’d been looking at bodies that were essentially completely unattainable without surgical intervention. And the owners of those bodies hadn’t been honest about it.",
            "There’s a lot to unpack here, so bear with me.",
            "Firstly, these women had clearly been given a huge boost in confidence as a result of the changes in their bodies. Their joy is so evident, it’s beautiful to witness. That happiness and comfort within themselves had probably been a big part of why I was following their content. They were no longer hiding themselves, and I know I’m not the only follower or fan to have noticed. But, with such a large number of women enjoying their content, should they have been honest about the work they had done? Therein lies the question.",
            "Part of me believes that they shouldn’t. It’s a very personal decision, so why should they announce it to thousands of people they have never met? It should be nobody else’s business.",
            "However, when we’re consuming so much content about other people’s lives, participating in “comparison culture” can happen without you even realising. It’s an easy road for some to go down, feeling as though they’re failing in some way because they haven’t managed to achieve a certain look no matter how hard they try, when someone else appears to have done it with great ease. However, as I learned recently, the ease isn’t always down to hours spent in the gym, but the incision of a surgeon’s knife. Essentially, it’s a look that’s unachievable without funds.",
            "The added layer to unpack is when gym content invariably starts popping up on those influencers’ feeds, giving the impression that it was secret hours spent in the gym that triggered the body transformation. As I now realise, the gym work is to maintain the effect of surgery, rather than the cause.",
            "It’s tricky, isn’t it? It’s a conversation I had recently with my Loose Women colleague Olivia Attwood-Dack, who has spoken honestly about the work she’s had done. She believes that men and women should not feel as though they have to be honest about it, but understands the impact being silent can have on others. It’s not a cut-and-dried argument.",
            "Irrespective of all this, what I love above everything else is honesty. Candice Brathwaite has kept her followers abreast of her health transformation for a while now, achieved through daily runs on a treadmill and different food choices, which she has documented. I’ve loved watching her journey, as through her honesty one can fully understand what’s really needed when you want to make changes not just to your health, but also to your wellbeing. If we can have more of that, and less of the cloak and dagger, perhaps more people will find that joy. I do hope so."

            "Rae joined the church of TB Joshua hoping her homosexuality could be 'fixed'. It was the start of 13 years of alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Here's how she escaped",
            "When Rae first travelled to TB Joshua’s church in Nigeria from her home in rural England, she was mesmerised by how the “holy” man appeared to cure people from the worst illnesses, and full of hope that her homosexuality could be “fixed”.",
            "“I got very very internalised homophobia, I knew from the age of about 12 that I was gay and thought, ‘Oh my god I have to get this fixed,’” she said.",
            "Rae – whose surname i has agreed to withhold – hails from a Christian family and was brought up in a conservative setting in a West Sussex village. She spent her childhood “climbing trees and running through the woods”.",
            "She was in her teens when she was first shown roughly cut VHS tapes of the “charismatic” evangelical leader – at one point among the most influential pastors in the world – carrying out supposed miracles.",
            "“I was quite bored of reading out of a Book of Common Prayer, I didn’t really get it,” Rae said, explaining what attracted her to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (Scoan). “They [Scoan] were saying that God is tangibly real.”",
            "During her last year of university, she booked a week-long “spiritual retreat” at the church in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city.",
            "She witnessed one woman, who was said to have breast cancer, allegedly being “cured” – TB Joshua “stretched his hand forward” and the woman’s breast appeared to “burst”.",
            "“To me, in that moment, there was absolute direct correlation between his action and the response of the person.",
            "“I just burst into tears… I was so overwhelmed with, not him or what happened but this sudden shocking reality that. ‘OMG, God is real…’ and thinking to myself, ‘You are in trouble, you have not been a very good girl.’",
            "“I had this sudden sense of overwhelm that I really needed to take my life very seriously and that God was all-seeing.”",
            "By the end of the week, she had been recruited to stay in the compound, marking the start of 13 years of alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the “prophet”.",
            "Rae is one of more than 25 former “disciples” who worked with BBC Africa Eye on investigating the alleged manipulation and abuse at the hands of Joshua. She recently appeared in Africa Eye’s investigation Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua.",
            "While Scoan did not respond to the allegations in the BBC investigation, it denied previous claims against Joshua. “Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,” it said.",
            "The church did not respond to i‘s request for comment.",
            "The pastor recruited people who visited his compound by “love-bombing” them and persuading them that he was “a representative for God on Earth”, Rae told i. They were told to call him “daddy” and always be loyal to him.",
            "“Once he got that in place he would then start knocking you down and let you know the areas of yourself that weren’t pleasing or acceptable,” she said, describing how she was put through rounds of “what I could consider conversion therapy” and was “regularly disgraced about the fact I was gay”.",
            "Under a system which Rae said was akin to “totalism”, followers underwent “thought reform” and within a week, “my mind was pretty much under the control of TB Joshua”.",
            "“I had abandoned friends, family, my former life,” said the 43-year-old, who now lives in Devon.",
            "She entered the cult at the age of 21. The accommodation was “super-basic”, with people sleeping on bunkbeds in dormitories where toilets were not private but only had a shower curtain as a door.",
            "Women were encouraged to walk around naked in the dormitory, while people were “drunk on lack of sleep” as they were not allowed more than three or fours a day. Meetings could be held at 3am despite people having allegedly worked most of the day in conditions akin to “modern-day slavery”.",
            "There was a “culture of forced reporting” of other disciples’ supposed wrongdoings, “to the degree where people would massively inflate any little thing just to carry favour with him.",
            "“People would lie, people would embarrass you, you are talking anything from somebody eating too long in the canteen to somebody being caught having a wank in the toilet.",
            "“It was really embarrassing stuff,” Rae said, adding that Joshua would often preplan the humiliations by forcing people into “coerced confessions”.",
            "Cult members were not allowed watches or phones, and internet use needed signed permission from Joshua, she added – and upon leaving the compound in 2013, she learned many people had tried to contact her over the years but she never received the emails.",
            "“We had police with AK-47s on the gates of the compound,” Rae said. While this may have been for safety reasons, the former disciple added: “Essentially you were trapped, all our passports were taken away, they were locked in a vault, we didn’t have access to them the entire time we were there.”",
            "Rae alleges she was one of many who were sexually assaulted by Joshua, with the abuse happening over a period of six months to a year. She says she had lost perception of time, but based on events that happened, she believes this was around 2003-2004.",
            "“There were several occasions within that period that he would phone me, call me to come up to his bedroom, assault, and then send me back down again,” she told i.",
            "Rae said her brainwashing meant she found justification in what Joshua allegedly did while blaming herself for it. “I very much felt like I was the sinner in the situation and even started questioning whether I was the cause of it. Did I have some evil spirit that had brought him down?”",
            "Eventually, she said, she was put in self-isolation for two years because she was still gay. This was not physical but it meant no one could talk to her and she was removed from work. She had a mental breakdown and tried to kill herself several times.",
            "“He’d prayed for me many many times and I was still gay and I was very very unhappy,” Rae added.",
            "However, while this was a punishment, “he kind of lost control of me” at this point, she explained, as Joshua knew about her suicidal thoughts and did nothing to help.",
            "The self-isolation led to a “crack in the armour”, which saw Rae regaining a “slight amount” of independent thinking.",
            "In 2013, during a work trip to Mexico, instead of returing to the compound, she decided to go back to her parents’ house in the UK as she did not feel Joshua had changed her sexuality or was likely to do so.",
            "“I realised that he had not been able to help me, I had been through several rounds of what I would consider conversion therapy, public deliverances over the course of time, and it became very apparent to me that I still had the same sex emotions towards women and this wasn’t going away.”",
            "Rae recalled the moment she realised that “maybe it wasn’t so bad to be gay” – while watching Ellen DeGeneres and seeing her happily married to her wife, Portia de Rossi.",
            "“I think, if it wasn’t for seeing the content from Ellen DeGeneres, I probably still would’ve stayed. It completely opened my mind to a different thought process. That particular thing was essentially what led me out of the place.",
            "“It’s quite ironic really. Being gay is what took me there and being gay is also what took me out and I am super-grateful for that.",
            "“I am not ashamed of anything related to who I am, I am a person, my gender and my orientation doesn’t make me any more or any less a person, it doesn’t make me who I am either, it’s just a part of me.”",
            "Rae accused the British Government of inaction over the alleged abuse of its citizens “trapped” in the cult under an “absolutely prolific rapist and predator”.",
            "She has claimed supposed welfare checks by the UK High Commission in Nigeria were inadequate, since UK citizens staying in the compound had been stripped of their passports and access to the outside world.",
            "She and other survivors have written to Foriegn Secretary Lord Cameron asking for him to confirm the Foreign Office will investigate allegations of wrongdoing against UK citizens, and pressure Nigerian authorities to close down Scoan. But she claims there was no response.",
            "A Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson told i: “We take all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously.",
            "“Our trained consular teams are contactable 24 hours a day, ready to offer support and advice to British nationals, including on how to report such crimes to the local authorities.",
            "“We always encourage British nationals who want to raise such allegations, whether current or historic, to contact.”",
            "i contacted the UK High Commission in Nigeria for comment, but has not received a response.",

		"When yet another person walks into Beth’s NHS urgent dental service after trying to remove their own teeth with pliers, she despairs. Not at the patients and what they’ve done to themselves, but at their agony caused by the shortage of NHS dentists.",
		"“That shouldn’t be happening; it’s awful,” says Beth, who has dealt with multiple “DIY” cases. “I can’t imagine how desperate people must be to do that, without anesthetic, when they don’t know what they’re doing.",
		"“During the pandemic, we saw the disasters that happen when people try DIY haircuts, but doing it with medical procedures is absolutely wild. In what other area of healthcare would people feel they have to attempt their own treatments? The situation is unacceptable.”",
		"Beth, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, works in NHS urgent care three days a week and at a private practice on the other two. Many of her shifts are spent performing emergency care to patients in evening clinics or at weekends.",
		"She often treats people – including children – who have barely any teeth left or need multiple extractions after being unable to see a general dentist. Based in the south-west of England, her area is a “dental desert”, where people can wait for years to enrol with an NHS practitioner.",
		"Nearly six million fewer courses of NHS dental treatment were provided in England in 2022/23, compared to the 38 million in the year before the pandemic. Scotland also has a problem, with people said to be travelling to Turkey and even as far as India for treatment.",
		"Across the UK, 22 per cent of people are not registered with a dentist, according to a YouGov poll last year. The health and social care select committee says this is “totally unacceptable”, but the problem is even worse in Beth’s county. “More than half the population are unregistered here,” she says.",
		"For some people, the results aren’t just painful, they’re fatal. The British Dental Association (BDA) fears that a decline in the availability of NHS dental services will “cost lives” to mouth cancer.",
		"The number of people who died from the disease in the UK in 2021 was up by 46 per cent from a decade earlier, according to figures obtained by the Oral Health Foundation.",
		"Around nine out of 10 sufferers survive at least five years when the disease is diagnosed early, but that typically requires regular dental check-ups. When it is spotted later, that survival rate drops to 50:50.",
		"“When I was in dental school,” says Beth, “I got the impression that I might see a couple of cases of oral cancer in my whole career. I’ve only been qualified for a few years, but already I’ve made six referrals that have resulted in cancer diagnoses.”",
		"She feels it is her duty to speak out about how so many unregistered patients in the UK are suffering and why she believes there is little sign of things improving, despite Government pledges.",
		"“What’s happening is shocking,” she says. “It’s awful and people need to know.”",
		"Saturday: Children with ruined mouths",
		"Today I was working in urgent out-of-hours care. Seeing emergency patients who don’t have a dentist gives me an insight into how the system is failing.",
		"These services are purely for people with severe problems that need immediate attention; things such as traumatic injuries, facial swellings or complications after surgery. We’re often double booked and have to stay late.",
		"The phones opened at 8.30am and our appointments were full within an hour. If more people call in, we sometimes send them to A&amp;E.",
		"I saw about 20 patients during the day. Two of them were children with severe facial swellings. One little boy was six years old and it was his first time seeing a dentist. He needed a tooth taken out. It’s hard enough for any child to be cooperative enough for us to do this, but it’s especially difficult when they’re so worried and unwell.",
		"We gave him an urgent referral to paediatrics at a community service, for the tooth to come out under general anaesthetic. But the waiting list is ridiculous. There are so many children on it, so before then we might see him as an emergency case again. And he might have other problems in the meantime – he had decay in almost every tooth.",
		"A few weekends ago, I saw a child who had just turned three. He had a case of “bottle caries”, where they’d been sleeping with a bottle in their mouth. This bathes teeth in milk and they can rot very quickly. This boy needed almost all of his teeth taking out under general anesthetic, leaving maybe four behind. His adult teeth won’t start to come through until he’s about seven, so he’ll start school with barely any teeth. That could affect his speech, his friendships – it’s a big deal. It sounds shocking, but you’d be surprised just how common it is.",
		"This is why we recommend a dental check-up for children before the age of one. Labour has suggested introducing supervised toothbrushing in schools if it wins the general election. I’d support anything that encourages children to brush their teeth more, because unfortunately there are neglectful parents out there – but often it’s too late by the time they’re in school. So would this have the desired effect? Probably not. And is it really the responsibility of teachers?",
		"NHS-funded dental services in England are in “widespread crisis” and “near-terminal decline”, according to the Nuffield Trust healthcare think-tank.",
		"In 2022, nine in every 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients, a BBC investigation found.",
		"Even when NHS treatment is accessible, 61 per cent of people still find the treatments expensive, discouraging many from going to check-ups, according to one survey by Healthwatch.",
		"With facial swellings, often there’s an infection and an abscess around the tooth. Sometimes the swelling is so severe the patient can barely open their mouth more than a finger’s width. That stops us getting to the problem. It’s a medical emergency too, because they can’t eat and could choke if they vomit.",
		"I had a patient in his 30s with this problem. He had already received two different antibiotics and his mouth opening hadn’t improved. We’re supposed to avoid using antibiotics too much because of the increase in resistance, but if everyone had access to NHS dentists and abscesses were being prevented through check-ups, we wouldn’t need to prescribe them so often.",
		"This guy was unregistered and hadn’t seen a dentist in about a decade. He needs a full clearance – all his teeth being removed and a denture being fitted to replace them. We can refer him to a community service for the extractions, but getting a denture will be difficult.",
		"Right now, however, he needed to have his jaw prised open and the infected tooth taken out. We couldn’t find anyone to see him, so we sent him to A&amp;E. I called the hospital to let them know he was coming, but he still had to wait because they were so busy. His frustrations boiled over and he abused some of the staff, so they refused to treat him. All I could do was prescribe more antibiotics and some very strong pain relief and he’ll have to wait until the consultant is willing to see him again.",
		"Monday: Letting down the most vulnerable",
		"Today I saw another 20 unregistered patients. One of them came into our emergency dental centre two years ago with severe toothache. He needed root canal treatment back then to save one of his teeth, but we could only do the first stage. He needed a general dentist to complete the job.",
		"For that, of course, people need to find a dentist they can register with. Good luck.",
		"Quite often people come back to us having been unable to find anyone on the NHS, by which time their tooth has worsened and needs to come out. That’s what had happened with this man. He’s in a good job and understands oral hygiene, he isn’t vulnerable and hasn’t done anything wrong, but now he has an abscess. He was saying: ‘I’ll get it done privately,’ but he’ll need to find the money.",
		"Later, I saw an elderly gentleman for another extraction. We see him in emergency care every couple of years; he’ll have a tooth out and go off again. He’s down to only a few teeth now, but we have no provision to give him dentures. That massively impacts his life, including his nutrition. We’ve relieved his pain for now, but his underlying problems aren’t being resolved.",
		"The other day in the emergency clinic, I took out 18 teeth. That’s pretty standard. In the past couple of years, I must have done thousands of extractions. It’s sad because almost every one is preventable.",
		"I also saw a homeless man in his 30s. Every one of his teeth has rotted right down to the stump, so he’s living in constant pain. It’s from a history of drug abuse and being put onto methadone, which is terrible for teeth. He’s been suffering for years, unable to eat normal meals. Today he had eight extractions and it was the next stage of making his denture.",
		"A ‘special-care patient’ was brought in by his parents. We have to make referrals for people with severe physical or cognitive disabilities, who might be non-verbal and live in supported accommodation. He can’t tell anyone if he’s in pain, but his parents noticed the signs. He needs a general anesthetic, but the waiting lists are so atrocious. It’s our most vulnerable people in society who suffer.",
		"The NHS dental crisis shot into the national consciousness again last month when hundreds of people began queuing down a street in Bristol in the hope of registering with a newly-opened practice.",
		"Police had to manage the line, which reportedly included a disabled cancer sufferer, who could barely stand.",
		"Their wait continued the following day, apparently leading to a fight over someone jumping the queue, and even lasted into a third day before all places at St Pauls Dental Practice were filled.",
		"Among those in the queue was 66-year-old teacher Norman Stephenson, who revealed he had tried using superglue to repair his dentures.",
		"Tuesday: Cancer concerns",
		"A patient who hasn’t had a dentist for about a decade came in for an emergency appointment recently. She had some loose teeth, and when I lifted up her lip, she also had a suspicious lesion that I worried could be more serious. I asked her: ‘Have you not noticed the huge ulcer?’ She had no idea it was there. We made an urgent referral for her to be tested by a specialist within two weeks, and now her results have come back",
		"I was right: it’s oral cancer.",
		"It was really sad hearing that news.",
		">It’s one of the least treatable cancers unless it’s caught really early. But it’s also asymptomatic until it reaches a bad level – so unless you’re lucky, you need to be seeing a dentist regularly for it to be spotted in time. This is totally overlooked by politicians.",
		"Most people don’t often look at the back of their throats, underneath their tongue, right up under their lips. We encourage the public to do this, in the same way that they’re meant to check their breasts or testicles, but our mouths can look quite odd to people who aren’t experts.",
		"This woman was diagnosed at a late stage, so she’s definitely in danger.  She’s in her 60s, but it can affect people of any age. She had been on the NHS waiting list for years and only had about six teeth remaining, with no dentures to replace the missing ones, so she was already struggling with nutrition.",
		"Seeing a dentist is not just about improving our health, it’s potentially life-saving. I know of one person who was diagnosed with a form of mouth cancer after it was picked up early during a routine appointment. They had an operation and they survived.",
		"They could afford to be seen regularly as a private patient. Imagine if they weren’t so fortunate and couldn’t get an NHS appointment: they could be dead.",
		"It was quite a difficult day all round. Another patient I saw was a man in his 20s with severe toothache, who had rung for an ambulance the day before, only to be turned away from A&amp;E because they won’t deal with toothache. But he was crying when he came in – he said he’d even thought about suicide because of the sheer pain. Toothache can be one of the worst things we experience. We did an emergency extraction, but he still went away with other problems that ought to be treated.",
		"A poll of 500 dentists last month found that 82 per cent had seen patients who have “taken matters into their own hands since lockdown”, according to the BDA.",
		"The TV presenter Paddy McGuinness told <em>Question Time</em> last month that his father “took his own teeth out because he couldn’t get a dentist appointment”.",
		"The 87-year-old mother of Labour MP Grahame Morris tried her luck with pliers. “My mother is 87 and very frail,” he told Parliament in January. “She did this out of desperation. It is appalling.”",
		"Caroline Pursey, 63, from Lincolnshire, told i last month that she pulled out four of her teeth after her NHS dentist went private. Her nearest alternative was 50 miles away with a three-year waiting list. “It was painful and they were growing on each other, so I couldn’t eat at all,” she explained.",
		"Chris Langston, 50, from Shropshire, pulled out a tooth because having it done privately would cost £90 and involve a 60-mile round trip. “I wouldn’t recommend it. Not to anyone. It was horrible,” he said.",
		"Given that many of the problems Beth sees are down to people being unable to access dental services, she says: “I would love to work in NHS general practice full-time.” But financially this “wouldn’t be viable”, she laments.",
		"Working in urgent care three days a week, Beth is in a salaried role – receiving around £35,000 a year from the NHS, which she is happy with. But most general practice dentists offering pre-booked appointments to NHS patients in England are self-employed, working under a contract that many feel is neither fair nor financially sustainable. This, they claim, is the main reason for worsening availability.",
		"The contract, introduced in 2006, means they are paid per completed course of treatment. This is banded but makes little allowance for how many procedures a treatment involves, nor how complex or time-consuming they are.",
		"When dentists see neglected mouths needing lots of attention – which is often the case with newly-registered patients – this can leave them out of pocket, says Beth. She has worked under the contract in the past, but would not do so again without radical change.",
		"“The Government has been driving a narrative to make ‘greedy dentists’ look like the villains, saying we’re abandoning the NHS to earn more money,” she argues.",
		"“It’s scary to think this, but you could do a whole day’s work and receive less than the minimum wage, because of the level of need in my county and how the NHS contract works. The system makes it impossible to do that and be able to live comfortably.",
		"“If they need one extraction and a denture, or if they need four root canals, six extractions and dentures, you’re paid the same – and then you have lab fees to pay,” she explains. “You can end up making a loss on some patients.” If all of the patients had severe needs, she would be in trouble.",
		"“I could work five days a week privately – there’s more than enough demand,” she adds. “Or I could work less and spend more time with my family. But I’ve seen how much people really need help. I don’t want to abandon patients with nowhere else to go. I can also see why people move away from the NHS.”",
		"“You could do a whole day’s work and receive less than the minimum wage”",
		"‘Beth’",
		"The prime minister admitted last month that it was “too difficult” to access an NHS dentist. Rishi Sunak recognised that it had been a particular “challenge” in Beth’s region, the south-west of England, but he said he hoped the Government’s £200m dental recovery plan would “fix” the problem.",
		"Up to 240 dentists will be given a £20,000 bonus if they open services in areas with poor NHS availability, and those taking on new patients will receive higher payments. Mobile dental vans will also be introduced for isolated and under-served communities. The Government hopes this “hugely ambitious and far-reaching plan” will lead to 1.5 million more treatments over the next year.",
		"But the BDA says the programme “won’t halt the exodus from the workforce” and fails to offer “real change”. Beth agrees.",
		"“It’s like putting a plaster on a bullet wound,” she says. “The little things they’re bringing in are not going to change the availability of services. They make small tweaks.”",
		"Labour has promised to provide an extra 700,000 urgent dental appointments and reform the NHS dental contract, together with other measures, if it wins the next election. The Nuffield Trust says the proposals “make good sense” but are “unlikely to stem the decline”.",
		"Beth is also angered by the clawback system, with dentists being penalised if they fail to meet strict targets on how many treatments they deliver. “Doctors would never have to pay money back to the NHS for not seeing a certain number of patients – such as when a surgeon sees one patient in a day, but it was a long operation.”",
		"Clawback can also result in “well over 10 per cent of dentistry’s £3bn budget” being lost to other areas of the NHS, according to the BDA. More broadly, the union warns of a “postcode lottery”, with nearly a third of local dental budgets going unspent in some areas of England because struggling practices miss targets.",
		"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told i: “The Government already invests more than £3bn each year to support NHS dentistry and we are starting to see progress. Last year, 1.7 million more adults and around 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared to the previous year.",
		"“Our new dental recovery plan, backed by £200m, will create an additional 2.5 million appointments over the next 12 months, including by offering cash incentives to practices to take on new NHS patients.",
		"“We are also strengthening the workforce through the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, which will expand dental undergraduate training places by 40 per cent per year by 2031 to 2032, with an initial 24 per cent increase by 2028 to 2029.”",
		"However, Beth maintains that “propaganda” about the recovery plan is “misleading” for those who have read the news and excitedly ask her if they will soon be able to register with a dentist.",
		"“It must be terrifying to live in a dental desert, like in my county,” she says. “There are literally no NHS practices here taking on new patients. When some children are born, their parents are told they’re going on a 10-year waiting list. In that time, they could have problems that affect their whole lives.",
		"“The system is spectacularly failing a lot of people.”"
