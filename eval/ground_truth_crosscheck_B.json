            "CLAIM: Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency called the U.S. Air Force an “enemy” of Israel in a post on X after an active-duty member of the military branch set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.",
            "AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The account that made the post is not affiliated with Mossad and has previously published erroneous claims about Israel. Mossad’s official X account, to which the agency’s website links, has not posted anything since September 2020.",
            "THE FACTS: After 25-year-old airman Aaron Bushnell self-immolated outside the Israeli Embassy, while declaring he “will not longer be complicit in genocide,” social media users alleged that Mossad had denigrated the U.S. Air Force on X in response.",
            "Many posts shared a screenshot of two posts from an account called “Mossad Commentary.” One includes an image of Bushnell on fire captioned with the widely-used expression, in Hebrew, “Am Yisrael chai,” meaning “the people of Israel live.” The second, made in response to the first, states: “Our enemies kill themselves.”",
            "The first post had been deleted by Monday afternoon, but an archived version shows that it was still up early in the morning. The second post remains live on the platform.",
            "“BREAKING: Mossad labels United States Air Force an ENEMY to the state of @Israel,” reads an X post from a different account that included the screenshot. It had received more than 10,600 likes and shares on Monday.",
            "But Mossad Commentary, which uses Mossad’s logo as its profile picture, is not affiliated with the Israeli intelligence agency and has previously made false claims about the Jewish state. For example, a post from October 2023 states that Yemen had “officially” declared war on Israel. The Associated Press reported at the time that Yemen’s internationally recognized government had done no such thing.",
            "Another post from the account called Bushnell “an idiot” after he set himself on fire.",
            "Mossad’s website links to its official X account, which is called in Hebrew “The Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks.” The most recent post is from September 2020.",
            "The Israeli military said Mossad Commentary is “clearly not an official account” in response to an email query from the AP. Mossad Commentary did not respond to a message from the AP on X.",
            "Bushnell died from his injuries. According to AP reporting, he had walked to the embassy shortly before 1 p.m. on Sunday and began livestreaming on Twitch, a video streaming platform. Law enforcement officials believe he set his phone down and then doused himself in accelerant and ignited the flames.",
            "Israel has adamantly denied genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in the Israel-Hamas war in accordance with international law.",

            "[Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.]",
            "[In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.]",
            "[Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.]",
            "When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.",
            "The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.",
            "That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.",
            "As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.",
            "Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.",
            "TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION",
            "Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.",
            "Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.",
            "\"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\"",
            "The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.",
            "The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.",
            "Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.",
            "\"If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said.",
            "Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.",
            "\"I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\"",
            "She added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\"",
            "REPUBLICAN HOPES",
            "The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.",
            "Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.",
            "Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.",
            "Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.",
            "A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.",
            "\"We’ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\""

            "That silky voice is perhaps best known for a number of erotic novels, including Hood Boyz Fall In Love Too 3, Nobody Can Love You Like Them Roughnecks Do 2, Fallin' For a Miami Hustla 3, and Mated to the Cyborgs.",
            "Nixon, a former police captain, has made a name for himself narrating steamy novels that have received thousands of reviews on Amazon. Those books are considerably more popular than Brown’s Desk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who Changed America, which is ranked 919,374th on Amazon’s best seller charts.",
            "Brown devotes each chapter of Desk 88 to a different senator who once sat at his desk. At several points throughout the book, Brown quotes lawmakers using the N-word. The pallid Brown, whose narration is limited to the chapter titles, lets the African-American Nixon read the slur, which comes twice from the Mississippi Democrat Theodore Bilbo, once from strategist Lee Atwater, and once from former vice president Al Gore, who was himself quoting Strom Thurmond.",
            "A spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Among the figures Brown profiles is former Ku Klux Klan member and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, whom the senator calls a \"complicated but necessary inclusion in a book about great progressives who sat at Desk 88.\"",
            "Fortunately for Brown, Nixon is no stranger to controversy. His voice often divides audiobook lovers, who carry out heated debates in the Amazon comments section. Reviewers were split on Nixon’s narration of What Happens on Vacation: A Flirty Vacation Romance, which details the fictitious African-American senator Jessup Outlaw’s winter romance.",
            "One listener dismisses Nixon’s voice as \"boring,\" while another calls him \"soothing,\" and praises him for guiding \"readers into discovering love.\"",
            "Nixon’s best performance, according to Amazon reviews, comes in The Right Player: A Sports Romance. One fan said Nixon’s voice was \"perfect for an evening on the couch. With your eyes closed so, you can listen and see the story unfold in your imagination.\"",
            "Listeners also raved about Her Naughty Suitor (Falling for a Rose), in which Nixon voices a real estate mogul with a \"desirous craving to explore everything about\" the book’s female protagonist.",
            "\"Oh my Gawd!! Lord, help me. I need a cigarette or a drink after reading ‘Her Naughty Suitor.’ And I don't smoke nor drink,\" one reviewer wrote on Amazon. \"I LOVED IT!!!!\"",
            "Brown is not the first Democrat to intersect with the world of romance novels. Two-time failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams once moonlit as a romance writer, cranking out books including Never Tell, the tale of a criminal psychologist who falls in love with a journalist as they seek to uncover the identity of a serial killer.",
            "Nor is Brown’s book the first foray into politics for Nixon, who took a break from bodice-rippers to help narrate an audiobook of the January 6th report."

It’s more of a question of not if they’re going to try to remove him, but when and how, and I don’t think they have the answers to either one.",
            "It’s really the most remarkable meltdown of a president we’ve seen in our modern era, and it’s juxtaposed with probably the greatest political recovery of Donald Trump since Richard Nixon in 1962.

            "[He stole Supreme Court seats, thwarted accountability for Donald Trump, and left a trail of partisan destruction in his wake.]",
            "On February 7, 2017, one of the darker days of his long, dark tenure as one of the most cynical partisans ever to serve in the Senate, then–majority leader Mitch McConnell prevented Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren from reading aloud a historic letter from Coretta Scott King that recalled some of the worst abuses of voting rights by then–Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Sessions, a conservative Republican whose nomination to serve as then-President Donald Trump’s first attorney general was under consideration by the chamber, was an ally of McConnell’s. More importantly, he was a fellow Republican. And the all-powerful majority leader decided he had heard more than enough criticism about his partisan compatriot’s sordid history of seeking to suppress the Black vote in Alabama.",
            "So McConnell employed a rule that bars a senator from ascribing “to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator” to silence his Democratic colleague—even though Warren was merely reading a letter from the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that described actual events and that was already a part of the Congressional Record. Sputtering with frustration, the majority leader went to the floor and infamously grumbled in his scolding tone, “Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”",
            "Seven years later, Warren still persists, having long ago turned McConnell’s words into a rallying cry for progressive women. She’s all but certain to win a new term, extending a distinguished Senate career that is likely to see her rise to the chairmanship of one or more key committees. Her contribution to the chamber has been great, and it will be greater.",
            "McConnell, on the other hand, is calling it quits after 17 years as the Senate Republican leader—six of them as majority leader—in which he invariably put party ahead of country and did more long-term damage to American democracy than any member of the Senate in modern US history.",
            "McConnell is the longest-serving Senate leader ever, but he is headed for the exits at the nadir of his power. If he once ruled as a mighty “lion of the Senate,” he leaves as something more like an 82-year-old toothless tiger. He’s now the minority leader in a chamber led by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Republican who once shaped the party’s direction not just on Capitol Hill but in Senate races across the country is on the outs with the base of a Grand Old Party where Trump—who despises McConnell—has shaped a cult of personality so intense that no room is left for leaders other than the former president. When McConnell returns to his home state for political events, he is heckled and met with cries of “Retire!” Now, he has begun the process of heeding those calls.",
            "“One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,” McConnell told colleagues Wednesday. “So I stand before you today…to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.”",
            "But don’t fret for McConnell, who will keep collecting his government checks, while he serves out the remainder of his seventh term. If awards are being handed out for political longevity, give him one. But McConnell’s record of partisan conniving and moral compromising merits no applause.",
            "One of two current senators who witnessed the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom—he was a sympathetic House intern looking on from near the Capitol, while Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) marched and rallied with the massive crowd of civil rights activists—McConnell arrived in the Senate in 1985 with a record as a something of a moderate on issues of race and labor rights, like his Kentucky mentors, Republican Senators John Sherman Cooper and Marlow Cook. But he quickly adjusted himself to the rightward thrust of a party in the thrall of then-President Ronald Reagan.",
            "Where Cooper had courageously opposed Republican President Richard Nixon’s pursuit of the Vietnam War, and where Cook cast a decisive vote in opposition to Nixon’s nomination of Judge G. Harrold Carswell, a Georgian with a track record of supporting segregation, to serve on the US Supreme Court, McConnell became the ultimate GOP hack. When it mattered most, he put party above the cooperation, party above the common good, party above the truth, and, ultimately, party above the Constitution.",
            "McConnell once notoriously declared that his highest political priority was unseating Democratic President Barack Obama, and he constantly manifested that same level of remorseless partisanship. Even when Obama was advancing legislation that would help Kentucky, in the form of the Affordable Care Act, McConnell moved to block it, leading a frustrated Cook to denounce his former aide and say, “If he had any knowledge of the lack of health and medical facilities in the hills of Kentucky, he’d know it’s a problem we need to solve. For Mitch McConnell to decide the new health program is not good for Kentucky—it tells me he’s not looking out for his own constituency.”",
            "As Capitol Hill’s most ardent advocate for big money in politics, and a prodigious fundraiser, McConnell kept his seat. And he used his growing power in the Senate to engage in ever more egregious acts of partisanship. Perhaps most brazenly, his cynical manipulation of the judicial confirmation process in 2016 prevented consideration of Judge Merrick Garland, a highly qualified if blandly moderate federal jurist, to serve on the US Supreme Court.",
            "McConnell’s refusal to allow the Senate to take up the Garland nomination relied on an obvious lie: the claim that the Senate could not weigh high court nominations in presidential election years. In fact, the majority leader was simply keeping the seat open until a Republican president could fill it with a right-wing judicial activist. After Donald Trump’s election, McConnell promptly steered Neil Gorsuch to confirmation in 2017. Then, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death created an election-year opening on the court in 2020, McConnell shamelessly raced to fill the seat with conservative Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett—finishing his long mission of tipping the balance on the court so that it had an aggressively hard-right, anti-abortion majority. In less than two years, 50 years of precedent was overturned, as McConnell’s court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the way for states to block access to reproductive rights.",
            "It is fair to say that McConnell’s judicial machinations will be his longest-lasting legacy. Decades from now, Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, whose tenures McConnell made possible, will be undermining civil liberties and upending protections for economic, social, and racial justice. But there is a powerful case that McConnell’s most miserable dereliction of duty came when he defended a Republican president he didn’t even like—and who didn’t like him.",
            "After the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a bipartisan House majority voted to impeach Donald Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. McConnell knew full well that Trump deserved to be convicted for the high crimes and misdemeanors the 45th president had committed. The Kentuckian effectively acknowledged as much with a speech to the Senate, in which he said:",
            "“There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day.",
            "”The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.",
            "”And their having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories, and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth.”",
            "With this understanding, McConnell should have rallied Senate Republicans to vote to hold Trump to account. Had he done so, there’s a good chance that a sufficient number of additional Republicans would have followed their leader in doing the right thing—creating the two-thirds majority that was needed to convict.",
            "But McConnell refused to do the right thing. He voted to acquit, and did more to renew Trump’s political prospects than any other Republican.",
            "McConnell swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For reasons of partisanship and personal political advancement, he abandoned that oath. Nothing more needs to be said of him."

            "[Crystal Clanton became notorious for sending outlandishly racist texts. Now she’s been hired to work for the Justice—and a dubious new story has surfaced to clear her name.]",
            "Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas shocked the legal community when the news broke that one of his new law clerks will be Crystal Clanton—who became notorious in 2015 for apparently sending texts that said, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all . . . I hate blacks. End of story.” For most young lawyers, sending such a text would indeed have been the “end of story.” Instead, Clanton is on the cusp of clinching one of the most coveted prizes in the American legal system. In the past several years, as Clanton has risen through the ranks of conservative legal circles, the story of her alleged racist outburst has been curiously transformed into a tale of victimhood. The new narrative is that Clanton was somehow framed by an unnamed enemy who—for motives that remain unclear—fabricated the racist texts to defame her.",
            "This new account has been greeted with suspicion by many. If the revised story is a lie, then it threatens to implicate not just Justice Thomas, who has endorsed it, but several lower-court federal judges and the leader of a major political group aligned with former President Donald Trump. Indeed, the whole affair may prove one of the most shopworn axioms of political reporting—that the coverup is worse than the crime.",
            "When the vile texts were sent, Clanton was the second-in-command and field director of the hard-right youth group Turning Point USA. The organization, a nonprofit advocacy group closely allied with Donald Trump’s Presidential aspirations in 2024, is well known for poisonous rhetoric: its leader, Charlie Kirk, has recently denigrated Martin Luther King, Jr., as “awful,” questioned whether Black pilots are capable of flying planes, and argued that televised public executions, perhaps by guillotine, should be held in America, with young people watching. Yet, even within Turning Point, colleagues were so shocked by the bluntness of Clanton’s alleged texts that they preserved screenshots of the messages, which were shared in 2017 with The New Yorker. At the time, multiple Turning Point employees told me that Clanton was the author of the messages.",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me, via e-mail, that she didn’t recall sending the texts, and that they seemed out of character. But when she was asked directly if she denied sending them she declined to answer. The screenshots of the messages bore her cell-phone number. Another former Turning Point employee, John Ryan O’Rourke, who was the recipient of the texts, said at the time that he preferred not to discuss them. Several other Turning Point colleagues had also seen and circulated the screenshots. And there was more evidence. In addition to the racist comments, the screenshots show Clanton asking, “Can I come to Starbucks in 5?”; she showed up at one, on cue, a few minutes later. (In 2018, the online platform Mediaite revealed another offensive statement by Clanton, sent on Snapchat. The post featured a photograph of a man who appeared to be Arab, accompanied by a caption that she had added: “Just thinking about ways to do another 9/11.”)",
            "In 2017, Clanton told me that she had resigned from Turning Point. Kirk, her boss at the time, made her departure sound less voluntary. In an e-mail, he told me that, after he learned of the texts, “Turning Point assessed the situation and took decisive action within 72 hours.” Four years later, a spokesman for Turning Point, Andrew Kolvet, confirmed the same set of facts to Ruth Marcus, a columnist for the Washington Post, telling her that Clanton was “terminated from Turning Point after the discovery of problematic texts.”",
            "The story would likely be long forgotten, were it not for an extremely strange plot twist. After the texting scandal, Ginni Thomas, the lobbyist and politically active wife of Clarence Thomas, who had worked closely with Clanton as an adviser to Turning Point, unofficially adopted Clanton as the couple’s protégée. The Thomases harbor deep anger at the mainstream media, stemming in part from the Justice’s embattled 1991 confirmation hearing, and evidently saw in Clanton a fellow-victim. Soon after leaving Turning Point, Clanton started working for Ginni Thomas. Remarkably, the Thomases then invited Clanton to live with them at their home in exurban Virginia, for the better part of the next year. The couple encouraged Clanton to go to law school, and Justice Thomas himself recommended her when she successfully applied to the Antonin Scalia Law School, at George Mason University. Justice Thomas also helped Clanton, who graduated in 2022, line up a prestigious judicial clerkship with Chief Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Pryor is one of the most conservative members of the federal bench, and a well-known “feeder” of clerks to Justice Thomas’s chambers.",
            "Supreme Court clerkships, which last for a year, are extremely valuable in both professional and financial terms. It’s common for former clerks to receive half-a-million-dollar bonuses when they sign on for their first law-firm jobs, and the credential eases the path to coveted academic and political positions. An extraordinary number of Thomas clerks—twenty-two, according to the Associated Press in 2018—populated the high ranks of the Trump Administration or were nominated by Trump for judgeships; others have fanned out across the nation to other prominent posts.",
            "Ordinarily, only the very best law students in the country, with the most impeccable résumés, get a shot at a Supreme Court clerkship. Presumably, a past that included termination for making grotesquely racist statements would present an obstacle. But Ginni Thomas’s intense enthusiasm for Clanton became evident in a leaked video of a 2019 closed-door session of the secretive Council for National Policy, a conservative leadership group to which both Ginni Thomas and Charlie Kirk belong. The video shows her introducing Clanton to the members as her special guest, and saying, “Crystal was for five years Charlie’s right-hand person, the wind in his sails, from a garage organization to this organization. And now she’s the wind in my sails.”",
            "In one sense, it hardly matters whom Justice Thomas hires as a law clerk. His conservative judicial views are well known and unwavering, and it’s improbable that one of his clerks would bend his decisions in any discernible way. Also, had Clanton apologized, it’s unlikely that many people would still care. But hiring a young woman who was fired for racial bigotry, and who has never apologized for it, could scarcely send a worse message to Black litigants and lawyers, or do more to undermine the Court’s promise—carved into its building’s grand façade—to deliver “Equal Justice Under Law.”",
            "Perhaps even more disturbing than Clanton’s hiring is the dubious revisionist history that has emerged to justify her selection. This refashioned narrative threatens to implicate the credibility of some of the most powerful legal officials in the country.",
            "In the fall of 2021, reports surfaced that Clanton had lined up two successive clerkships: the first with U.S. District Court Judge Corey Maze, of the Northern District of Alabama, and the second with Judge Pryor, of the Eleventh Circuit. Ruth Marcus, the Washington Post opinion writer, posted a column asking of Pryor, “Why is a prominent federal judge hiring a law clerk who said she hates Black people?” Democrats on Capitol Hill filed an ethics complaint with the Eleventh Circuit, complaining that Maze and Pryor had hired “an individual with a history of nakedly racist and hateful conduct.” They warned that placing such a person in “close proximity to judicial decision-making threatens to seriously undermine the public’s faith” in the federal courts. And they argued that no member of any minority would “trust that they will receive equal justice before these judges.”",
            "The federal judiciary’s self-policing process is abstruse enough to delight fans of “Bleak House.” The complaint was transferred to the Second Circuit, in New York, where Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, an appointee of George W. Bush, began an inquiry. The confidential process took place behind closed doors, but Bill Rankin, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, obtained letters that Justice Thomas and Judge Pryor sent to the Second Circuit in support of Clanton. Justice Thomas wrote that his wife had “informed me of the horrible way” Clanton “had been treated at Turning Point and asked that she be allowed to live with us.” The implication was that Clanton had been victimized at Turning Point.",
            "Pryor added more detail. He put forward a novel defense of Clanton, which he attributed to conversations he’d had with Justice Thomas, along with a previously unmentioned set of facts provided by Charlie Kirk. According to this new account, Clanton was actually the victim of an unidentified former employee, who, for unknown reasons, had framed her as the author of the racist texts. It was not explained why this outlandishly devious plot hadn’t been exposed earlier—not at the time of her resignation, nor when Clanton was interviewed by The New Yorker, nor during the subsequent four years, when Turning Point’s spokesman consistently confirmed that Clanton had been fired for sending the texts.",
            "According to Pryor’s letter, Clanton had been unable to deny the allegations about the racist texts earlier because she had been bound by a nondisclosure agreement, the existence of which she evidently had failed to mention to reporters at the time. If there was an N.D.A., Clanton also didn’t mention it to a lawyer to whom she referred my questions in 2017. The lawyer, Robert Grabemann, told me that he hadn’t prepared an N.D.A. for her and wasn’t aware that one existed. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at N.Y.U. who is considered a leading authority on questions of judicial ethics, said the claim that an N.D.A. prevented Clanton from telling the truth earlier “is simply not credible,” adding, “I’ve seen my share of N.D.A.s, and I can’t imagine one that would forbid a person to deny making racist statements. I don’t know how one might even word such an N.D.A. To me, this claim is preposterous and strong evidence that information needed for public understanding of these events has been hidden.”",
            "In Pryor’s letter, he said Justice Thomas had assured him that Clanton “was a victim of a pernicious attempt to portray her as a racist.” Kirk, meanwhile, had told Pryor “the media has alleged that Crystal said and did things that are simply untrue.” Instead, Kirk claimed, the real culprit was a former employee who had “created fake text messages to be used against other employees,” in order to make it seem as though they had engaged in misconduct. The real culprit’s name was not identified.",
            "Clanton did not respond to a request for comment. When I reached Kirk to ask him to explain his volte-face on Clanton’s responsibility for the texts, he referred me to his spokesman, who said that he had no comment on the veracity of the new version of the facts, even though it contradicted the explanation that he had provided before. Moreover, when I checked this new account with former Turning Point employees, they hadn’t heard anything about faked texts, or were aware of any other employee having been held responsible for the elaborate ruse. And when Marcus, at the Washington Post, inquired about the new origin story for the texts, a former Turning Point staffer simply replied, “Not fake,” and declined to say more. In a column, Marcus, a graduate of Harvard Law School, deemed the revisionist narrative “not credible.”",
            "Nonetheless, Judge Livingston seemed satisfied. Without obtaining the disputed texts or interviewing key witnesses, she dismissed the ethics complaint against Judge Pryor and Judge Maze. In her ruling, Livingston echoed the claim that the original news coverage was false, and that Clanton had always treated everyone with “kindness, respect and fairness.” She wrote that a Turning Point executive—clearly Kirk—had explained that a different employee “was fired after the organization learned that this person had created fake text messages to be used against coworkers, to make it appear they had engaged in misconduct, when they had not.” Livingston noted that Clanton was highly qualified, and that Pryor and Maze knew about the allegations against Clanton before offering her the coveted clerkships, and that both had determined the allegations of racist behavior by Clanton to be untrue. The “undisputed record,” Livingston concluded, shows that Pryor and Maze “performed all the due diligence that a responsible Judge would undertake.”",
            "Critics howled. Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia on the House Judiciary Committee, who helped initiate the ethics complaint, declared that “the 2nd Circuit’s decision does a disservice to everyone involved,” adding, “This cannot be the end of the matter.” (When I reached out to Livingston, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts replied that misconduct proceedings are “confidential by statute. So Chief Judge Livingston cannot comment.”)",
            "There was one final attempt to get to the bottom of the allegations. The Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee of the U.S. Judicial Conference asked a special committee to gather more evidence. The committee told the Second Circuit that it needed to go back and find out whether Clanton had, in fact, made the racist statements attributed to her, and exactly what Clanton had told Pryor and Maze about the matter. It pointed out that Clanton “has never publicly denied the allegations,” and noted that “there are numerous individuals with first-hand knowledge of the candidate’s alleged conduct.” At a minimum, it said, “the special committee should attempt to interview the candidate and the witnesses identified in the media reports we have cited.”",
            "But that didn’t happen. Instead, Judge Pryor and Judge Maze invoked a legal rule to bar the Judicial Conference from reopening Livingston’s findings. Jeremy Fogel, the director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute and a retired federal judge, told me, in an e-mail, that those who support Justice Thomas’s outlook “likely will argue that this decision clearly is within his discretion as a justice, especially given the close working relationship and level of trust expected between justices and their law clerks.” His critics, however, “will see this as another example of his willingness to ignore ethical rules.” (Justice Thomas and Ginni Thomas declined to comment for this story, as did Judge Maze. Judge Pryor did not respond to a request for comment.)",
            "Either way, with the help of some rather powerful patrons, and a weak judicial-ethics system, Crystal Clanton is on her way to clerk at the highest court in the land. Eric Segall, a law professor at the Georgia State University College of Law, who served in George H. W. Bush’s Justice Department, told me, “Can you imagine what would happen if a Black person who said ‘I hate all white people’ ended up clerking for Sotomayor? You’d never hear the end of it on Fox News. But there’s almost total silence about this.” ♦"

            "President Biden underwent a physical Wednesday, and his doctor said the “most notable” change in the past year concerned the 81-year-old’s sleep apnea — a disorder associated with an increased risk of dementia.",
            "Last year, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said Mr. Biden began using a positive airway pressure mask, which delivers pressurized air into the nose and mouth to make sure the sleep apnea sufferer has enough oxygen.",
            "“We revisited the issue this past spring and conducted a formal sleep study,” Dr. O’Connor wrote in his summary. “This study confirmed my suspicion that the president would benefit from optimizing his sleep efficiency with PAP.”",
            "Mr. Biden was first diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2008. The doctor’s notes indicate it could be getting worse.",
            "More than 30 million Americans have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, which can cause sufferers to choke and gasp dozens of times per hour as they sleep. As a person ages, the effects of the disorder often get worse.",
            "A 2022 study found patients with sleep apnea have a 43% higher risk of developing any type of neurocognitive disorder, a 28% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 54% higher risk of Parkinson’s disease.",
            "“People with sleep apnea who spend less time in deep sleep are more likely to have brain health problems that could lead to dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or a stroke, a new study shows,” WebMD wrote in May, citing a Journal of Sleep Research probe published in the medical journal Neurology.",
            "The study compared people with amyloid plaques in the brain, an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. “We found that people with amyloid plaques who had more severe sleep apneas also were more likely to have lower volumes in the medial temporal lobe area of the brain, including the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Geraldine Rauch wrote.",
            "Researchers say the sleep apnea link with dementia is probably caused by the brain being starved of oxygen during sleep, which can damage blood vessels and lead to the development of plaque.",
            "Dr. O’Connor noted that Mr. Biden had difficulty adjusting to the PAP mask. “This is reasonably anticipated and, in fact, should be expected. … But with trials of several different masks, we have been able to identify a couple of products which fit him very comfortably and effectively,” the doctor said.",
            "In addition to sleep apnea, the physical revealed Mr. Biden suffers from an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, which drastically raises the risk of stroke. The president has suffered from the condition since 2003, and Dr. O’Connor says he continues to take the blood thinner apixaban, brand name Eliquis, to treat the heart condition.",
            "Heart arrhythmia can cause blood clots, which, if they break loose, can travel directly from the heart to the brain, causing a stroke. People who suffer from the disorder have a much greater risk of stroke.",
