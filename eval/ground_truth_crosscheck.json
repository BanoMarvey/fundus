            "CLAIM: Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency called the U.S. Air Force an “enemy” of Israel in a post on X after an active-duty member of the military branch set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.",
            "AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The account that made the post is not affiliated with Mossad and has previously published erroneous claims about Israel. Mossad’s official X account, to which the agency’s website links, has not posted anything since September 2020.",
            "THE FACTS: After 25-year-old airman Aaron Bushnell self-immolated outside the Israeli Embassy, while declaring he “will not longer be complicit in genocide,” social media users alleged that Mossad had denigrated the U.S. Air Force on X in response.",
            "Many posts shared a screenshot of two posts from an account called “Mossad Commentary.” One includes an image of Bushnell on fire captioned with the widely-used expression, in Hebrew, “Am Yisrael chai,” meaning “the people of Israel live.” The second, made in response to the first, states: “Our enemies kill themselves.”",
            "The first post had been deleted by Monday afternoon, but an archived version shows that it was still up early in the morning. The second post remains live on the platform.",
            "“BREAKING: Mossad labels United States Air Force an ENEMY to the state of @Israel,” reads an X post from a different account that included the screenshot. It had received more than 10,600 likes and shares on Monday.",
            "But Mossad Commentary, which uses Mossad’s logo as its profile picture, is not affiliated with the Israeli intelligence agency and has previously made false claims about the Jewish state. For example, a post from October 2023 states that Yemen had “officially” declared war on Israel. The Associated Press reported at the time that Yemen’s internationally recognized government had done no such thing.",
            "Another post from the account called Bushnell “an idiot” after he set himself on fire.",
            "Mossad’s website links to its official X account, which is called in Hebrew “The Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks.” The most recent post is from September 2020.",
            "The Israeli military said Mossad Commentary is “clearly not an official account” in response to an email query from the AP. Mossad Commentary did not respond to a message from the AP on X.",
            "Bushnell died from his injuries. According to AP reporting, he had walked to the embassy shortly before 1 p.m. on Sunday and began livestreaming on Twitch, a video streaming platform. Law enforcement officials believe he set his phone down and then doused himself in accelerant and ignited the flames.",
            "Israel has adamantly denied genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in the Israel-Hamas war in accordance with international law.",

We’ll all miss her, as I know her family will.”",

            "Two people, Dominic M. Miller and Lyndell Mays, have been charged with second-degree murder of the 43-year-old mother of two.",
            "The parade was intended to celebrate another milestone accomplishment for the Chiefs — becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl champions since New England in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Instead, it sent the Chiefs and their city into an offseason full of heavy hearts.",
            "“Before we get into the football topics, I’d like to definitely start off by offering our thoughts and prayers to Lisa Lopez-Galvan and her family, all the families that were impacted the day of the parade,” Veach said. “Certainly, a heartbreaking and tragic day for us. Our organization has been in contact with the families, and we will continue to do so and be a pillar of support for them both now and into the future.”",
            "Veach went on to thank the first responders who tended to the victims and helped bystanders navigate their way to safety.",

We can turn this, which was a negative, into a real positive. With just a little togetherness and love, we can fix a lot of problems.”",

            "The Nature Restoration plan has had a rough ride through the EU’s complicated approval process, and a watered-down version will proceed to a final vote by the EU member states, where it is expected to survive.",
            "“Today’s vote to get the Nature Restoration Law over the finish line offers fresh hope for Europe’s ability to combat the worst effects of climate change and biodiversity loss for decades to come,” said Noor Yafai of the global environmental group The Nature Conservancy.",
            "Under the plan, member states would have to meet restoration targets for specific habitats and species, with the aim of covering at least 20% of the region’s land and sea areas by 2030. But quarrels over exemptions and flexibility clauses allowing member states to skirt the rules plagued negotiations.",
            "The bill was adopted earlier by a 329-275 vote with 24 abstentions after the center-right Christian Democratic European People’s Party of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen decided to vote against it.",

            "“Why a SPAC? I see it really as a reverse listing in America,” Fernandes said. “SPACs have got a bad name because a lot of these were, I’m going to be frank, hair-brained business schemes, sending people to the moon. … We’re generating real cash flow, real profits,” he added.",
            "On a smaller scale, AirAsia’s path will mirror that of Singapore-based, Southeast Asia-focused Grab\n, a “super app” service, which began trading on the Nasdaq in December 2021 after closing a SPAC merger.",

Anyone could submit a nomination on behalf of any woman from any company or organization with at least $25 million in revenue in at least one of the past three years or an enterprise value of at least $100 million. Nominees/nominators were asked to complete a detailed nomination form. This questionnaire contained quantitative and qualitative information which was used as the basis for CNBC’s evaluation.",

This could be anything from launching a new product or service, to leading a turnaround effort, to sparking a viral cultural moment or movement. Whatever it was, it was important in the selection process that we identify a reason why each woman named to the list deserved the honor this year. Next year, we’ll choose a whole new list of 50 women, and it is entirely possible that many of those women were nominated this year.",
            "In all, CNBC received more than 700 nominations from women across the business and cultural landscape, from companies and organizations ranging from small startups to the world’s most valuable multinationals.",
            "The evaluation of the 700-plus nominees began with a quantitative assessment. Nominees were evaluated on five broad categories: results of the achievement in 2023; influence of the individual woman leader; reach of the company/organization, representation, and experience. Nominee scores in each category were then weighted according to a survey completed by members of the Changemakers Advisory Board. The board determined that “Results” and “Influence” were the most important categories, while “Experience” was given the lowest weighting of the five categories.",
            "After the quantitative evaluation, approximately one-third of the nominees were selected to move forward to a second round, which included a qualitative assessment, based on their weighted total scores. To move on to round two, nominees either scored in the top 25% overall, scored in the top 25% in a key category (such as “startup founder” or “nonprofit CEO”), or they received a recommendation from one or more of the Advisory Board members as part of their initial survey.",
            "For round two, the remaining nominees were divided into groups of 30 for qualitative assessment. A team of CNBC editorial staff, along with members of the Advisory Board, read the responses submitted with each nomination and assigned up to five points for each of three criteria. These were:",
            "Contribution: Looking specifically at the response to “Contribution to the business world in 2023,” scorers assessed the contribution the applicant made to the business world, and to broader society, last year",
            "Transformational Change: Scorers were to assess whether the specific contribution, as well as the balance of the nominee’s work, and the manner in which that work is done, represents a fundamental shift in the way business gets done. More specifically, scorers were asked to look for ways in which nominees reject traditional male archetypes of business leadership and lead with their own authentic, unique strengths.",
            "Inspiring Leader: Scorers were asked whether the applicant’s story inspires them, and whether it will inspire her employees, customers and investors.",
            "Qualitative scores were added to the quantitative score from round one, with each weighted equally (50% qualitative, 50% quantitative), and nominees were re-ranked according to their total scores.",
            "A smaller group of CNBC editorial senior staff performed a final editorial review, which involved some additional research, discussion and debate to determine the final 50 nominees to make the list. This being the first year, extra scrutiny was applied to the quantitative methodology and the qualitative review to account for potential irregularities in the data as well as for any personal biases. However, two-thirds of the women named to the list ranked in the top 50 before our editorial review.",

It includes 15 startup CEOs and founders whose companies have a total valuation of more than $47 billion, and 11 public company CEOs overseeing firms with a combined market cap of about $170 billion. In addition, it features five women deploying technology to amplify the philanthropic impact of their organizations and four women shaking up the world of sports business. Nearly one-fifth of the women are based outside the U.S.",
            "Each has accomplished a meaningful achievement in 2023, propelling a major business to a new level of growth and often tackling issues of significant importance to society.",
            "Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, secured key manufacturing capacity at the dawn of a blockbuster weight-loss drug era and worked to lower the prices for insulin drugs amid heightened political scrutiny of prescription costs. RePurpose Global CEO and co-founder Svanika Balasubramanian is working to minimize and repurpose plastic waste alongside hundreds of consumer brands. Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has taken on the baby formula shortage with a new product, while Baby2Baby co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof are upending the status quo in diaper manufacturing and distribution.",
            "In some cases, Changemakers are taking their star power to build out new market opportunities. Alex Cooper is changing the podcast business and building a new kind of audio media empire. Actor Tracee Ellis Ross is changing the hair-care industry and more with Pattern Beauty. Naomi Osaka is shaking things up both on the tennis court and off with her media company and skincare line.",
            "In reviewing the Changemakers, CNBC identified a couple of key trends. First, this new generation of women leaders is aligning purpose and profits, creating businesses that succeed when they achieve environmental or social good. At rePurpose Global, Balasubramanian created a model that succeeds when companies take steps to reduce their plastic production and environmental impact. Jessica Chang, the CEO of Upwards, is reimagining the business of child care to make it more widely accessible and affordable. Maayan Cohen created Hello Heart to help individuals manage cardiovascular health, while helping employers manage costs.",
            "Changemakers are also reformers, inventing new approaches to fix broken systems. And many of them are providing female consumers with new, much-needed options in areas that have often been overlooked. Kate Ryder is closing major gaps in women’s and family health care with Maven. Mielle Organics founder Monique Rodriguez created new options for natural hair care. National Women’s Soccer League Commissioner Jessica Berman is proving the broad appeal of women’s sports and closing the pay gap among professional athletes.",
            "And we’re seeing several women forge new paths in renewable energy, such as Dandelion Energy CEO Kathy Hannun, who is working to create a new market for geothermal energy, and Twelve’s Etosha Cave, who is focused on turning CO2 and water into aviation fuel.",
            "While women continue to be underrepresented in the world of technology, and particularly in the cutting-edge area of artificial intelligence, several of this year’s Changemakers are playing key roles in using AI to improve and accelerate their businesses and others. Clara Shih, as the CEO of Salesforce AI, is helping companies deploy AI across their organizations. Michelle Zatlyn, co-founder and chief operating officer at Cloudflare, is giving companies AI tools to bolster cybersecurity and lower costs for vulnerable, critical infrastructure providers, including schools and local election systems. Kristin Peck, CEO of animal health company Zoetis\n, is using AI to improve outcomes for pets and their owners.",
            "All these women are trailblazers in their fields, with inspiring stories and unique approaches. The Changemakers serve as a reminder that success is a result of leading in ways that are authentic.",
            "[CNBC’s Julia Boorstin is the author of “When Women Lead,” which weaves together the stories of women who have defied the odds to found and run successful organizations, with data explaining how they did it.

            "[Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.]",
            "[In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.]",
            "[Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.]",
            "When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.",
            "The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.",
            "That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.",
            "As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.",
            "Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.",
            "TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION",
            "Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.",
            "Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.",
            "\"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\"",
            "The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.",
            "The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.",
            "Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.",
            "\"If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said.",
            "Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.",
            "\"I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\"",
            "She added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\"",
            "REPUBLICAN HOPES",
            "The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.",
            "Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.",
            "Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.",
            "Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.",
            "A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.",
            "\"We’ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\""

            "However, late Wednesday, Hunter's attorney Abbe Lowell seemed to cast doubt on that, saying in a statement, \"The transcripts of witnesses who have been called to date, including Hunter’s, makes it obvious that there is nothing left to ask, answer, say or do. This illegitimate inquiry should have ended long before their star witness was indicted for lying but it wasn’t. Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is — on the record and under oath — this political charade should finally come to an end.\"",
            "Hunter appeared on Capitol Hill for his closed-door deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday.",
            "The first son testified that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in a \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry against his father. He also said Republicans have no evidence against his father, the president, \"because there isn't any.\"",
            "Comer, R-Ky., made a public statement Wednesday afternoon, saying that Hunter’s appearance \"was a great deposition for us.\"",
            "Hunter, however, thought the deposition went well for him. On his way out of the hearing room Wednesday, he told reporters he thought the hearing went \"great.\"",
            "A source with direct knowledge of the deposition told Fox News Digital that Hunter \"first made clear in his opening statement and emphasized throughout the deposition, Joe Biden was not involved in, did not benefit from, and took no official actions to benefit any of his business ventures.\"",
            "Regarding the infamous \"10 held by H for the big guy?\" email, the source said Hunter told the committee that his associate who sent the message, James Gilliar, was \"out of his mind for even suggesting Joe Biden get involved in their joint venture.\"",
            "\"Hunter discussed his addiction at length,\" the source said, adding that Hunter \"admitted that he was high or drunk when he sent the ‘sitting here with my father’ WhatsApp message, sent it to the wrong recipient, and is now embarrassed by the message.\"",
            "That text was sent to a business partner for Chinese energy firm CEFC.",
            "The source said Hunter also testified that his dad \"was not sitting next to him.",
            "But Comer said after the deposition that \"it proves several bits of our evidence that we've been conducting throughout this investigation.\"",
            "Comer added that \"there are also some contradictory statements that I think need further review.\"",
            "\"So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing,\" Comer said.",
            "Comer stressed that Hunter and his attorney have \"demanded\" a public hearing following the deposition.",
            "\"Just as I said, when we said we were going to do the deposition first, we will have a public hearing next,\" he explained. \"So I think that the public hearing hopefully will clear up some discrepancies between some of the statements that were made between some of the associates and what we heard today.\"",
            "Indeed, Lowell said back in November 2023, \"Hunter is eager to have the opportunity, in a public forum and at the right time, to discuss these matters with the Committee.\"",
            "Comer said \"all in all,\" he is \"very optimistic, very excited about this deposition.\"",
            "\"I look forward to releasing the transcripts as soon as both sides agree to that,\" Comer said, hinting that the first son’s transcript of his deposition could be released to the public by the end of the week. \"Hopefully that'll be within the next two or three days.\"",
            "During his opening statement Wednesday, obtained by Fox News, Hunter testified that he was present \"to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business.\"",
            "\"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never,\" he stressed. \"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.\"",
            "The first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"",
            "\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.",
            "Hunter's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.",
            "House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.",
            "Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.",
            "After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\"",

            "[Biden is hoping to address his deep unpopularity on immigration]",
            "President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.",
            "Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
            "Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.",
            "Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.",
            "CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.",
            "Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in Fiscal Year 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.",
            "Eagle Pass has also been the center of an ongoing standoff and court battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the administration over border-related issues, including setting up razor-wire and a new anti-illegal immigration law.",
            "The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.",
            "\"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said aboard Air Force One on Wednesday. \"He will reiterate his calls for congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.",

            "AudioFile Magazine praised the audio version of Senator Sherrod Brown’s latest book as \"intriguing,\" not just for the Ohio Democrat’s prose, but the \"thoughtful tone\" of co-narrator Leon Nixon.",
            "That silky voice is perhaps best known for a number of erotic novels, including Hood Boyz Fall In Love Too 3, Nobody Can Love You Like Them Roughnecks Do 2, Fallin' For a Miami Hustla 3, and Mated to the Cyborgs.",
            "Nixon, a former police captain, has made a name for himself narrating steamy novels that have received thousands of reviews on Amazon. Those books are considerably more popular than Brown’s Desk 88: Eight Progressive Senators Who Changed America, which is ranked 919,374th on Amazon’s best seller charts.",
            "Brown devotes each chapter of Desk 88 to a different senator who once sat at his desk. At several points throughout the book, Brown quotes lawmakers using the N-word. The pallid Brown, whose narration is limited to the chapter titles, lets the African-American Nixon read the slur, which comes twice from the Mississippi Democrat Theodore Bilbo, once from strategist Lee Atwater, and once from former vice president Al Gore, who was himself quoting Strom Thurmond.",
            "A spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Among the figures Brown profiles is former Ku Klux Klan member and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, whom the senator calls a \"complicated but necessary inclusion in a book about great progressives who sat at Desk 88.\"",
            "Fortunately for Brown, Nixon is no stranger to controversy. His voice often divides audiobook lovers, who carry out heated debates in the Amazon comments section. Reviewers were split on Nixon’s narration of What Happens on Vacation: A Flirty Vacation Romance, which details the fictitious African-American senator Jessup Outlaw’s winter romance.",
            "One listener dismisses Nixon’s voice as \"boring,\" while another calls him \"soothing,\" and praises him for guiding \"readers into discovering love.\"",
            "Nixon’s best performance, according to Amazon reviews, comes in The Right Player: A Sports Romance. One fan said Nixon’s voice was \"perfect for an evening on the couch. With your eyes closed so, you can listen and see the story unfold in your imagination.\"",
            "Listeners also raved about Her Naughty Suitor (Falling for a Rose), in which Nixon voices a real estate mogul with a \"desirous craving to explore everything about\" the book’s female protagonist.",
            "\"Oh my Gawd!! Lord, help me. I need a cigarette or a drink after reading ‘Her Naughty Suitor.’ And I don't smoke nor drink,\" one reviewer wrote on Amazon. \"I LOVED IT!!!!\"",
            "Brown is not the first Democrat to intersect with the world of romance novels. Two-time failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams once moonlit as a romance writer, cranking out books including Never Tell, the tale of a criminal psychologist who falls in love with a journalist as they seek to uncover the identity of a serial killer.",
            "Nor is Brown’s book the first foray into politics for Nixon, who took a break from bodice-rippers to help narrate an audiobook of the January 6th report."

            "Texas senator John Cornyn on Thursday announced his intentions to run to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as the Republican leader in Congress's upper chamber.",
            "\"I am asking my Republican colleagues to give me the opportunity to succeed Leader McConnell,\" Cornyn said in a statement. \"I have learned a lot during my time both in and out of Senate leadership.\"",
            "Cornyn, 72, served as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) between 2009 and 2013, and he said he \"laid the foundation\" for Republicans to take control of the Senate in 2014. He also served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019, and he highlighted in the announcement that he helped secure the confirmations of Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh under former president Donald Trump.",
            "\"We will improve communication, increase transparency, and ensure inclusion of every member’s expertise and opinion,\" he promised. \"We will restore the important role of Senate committees and reestablish the regular appropriations process, rather than lurch from one crisis to another. And we will return power back to our members; there will be no more backroom deals or forced votes on bills without adequate time for review, debate, and amendment.\"",
            "Cornyn, the first to publicly announce his intent to run, is one of several Republicans who could take the leadership role left by McConnell, who announced Wednesday he would step down as the GOP leader in November. Minority whip Sen. John Thune (S.D.) and Senate conference chair John Barrasso (Wyo.) are expected to seek the position. Other potential successors include Sen. Steve Daines (Mont.), now the leader of the NRSC, as well as former NRSC chair Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.) and conference vice chair Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), according to the Washington Post."

            "Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei on Wednesday blamed \"Western culture\" for the self-immolation of U.S. airman Aaron Bushnell outside of the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C.",
            "\"The genocide in Gaza is even too much for that young person who was brought up in the Western culture,\" Khamenei said on X. \"His conscience was hurting and he set himself on fire.\"",
            "Hours earlier, the ayatollah had also attributed Bushnell's actions to \"antihuman\" policies the West has propagated.",
            "\"The West’s disgraceful antihuman policies with regard to the genocide in Gaza have reached such a point that a U.S. military officer sets himself on fire,\" he said in the earlier post.",
            "Just after Khamenei made his posts, Iran's Press TV eulogized Bushnell, calling his self-immolation a \"tragic protest against genocide\" and a \"fiery stand for Palestine.\" Its X post contained a video describing Bushnell's actions, featuring lightly censored footage of his suicide.",
            "Bushnell on Sunday said that he would \"no longer be complicit in genocide\" before he stood outside the embassy and lit himself on fire, yelling, \"Free Palestine.\" He later succumbed to his injuries.",
            "In the days following, left-wingers in the United States—including third-party presidential candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein—valorized his actions. Additionally, Hamas praised him, saying in a statement that he would \"remain immortal in the memory of our Palestinian people.\""

President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump are both scheduled to visit the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday following an unprecedented surge of migrants in recent months.",

            "The brief also accused House speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) and House Republicans of \"play[ing] politics at the expense of border security.\" Earlier this month, Biden lashed out at Trump for allegedly pushing to block the border security bill. \"All indications are this bill won’t even move forward to the Senate floor,\" Biden said, \"because Donald Trump thinks it’s bad for him politically and [would] rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.\""

            "Russian president Vladimir Putin told Western countries on Thursday they risked provoking a nuclear war if they sent troops to fight in Ukraine, warning that Moscow had the weapons to strike targets in the West.",
            "The war in Ukraine has triggered the worst crisis in Moscow's relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, but his nuclear warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit.",
            "Addressing lawmakers and other members of the country's elite, Putin, 71, repeated his accusation that the West was bent on weakening Russia, and he suggested Western leaders did not understand how dangerous their meddling could be in what he cast as Russia's own internal affairs.",
            "He prefaced his nuclear warning with a specific reference to an idea, floated by French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday, of European NATO members sending ground troops to Ukraine—a suggestion that was quickly rejected by the United States, Germany, Britain, and others.",
            "\"[Western nations] must realize that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilization. Don't they get that?!\" said Putin.",
            "Speaking ahead of a March 15-17 presidential election when he is certain to be reelected for another six-year term, he lauded what he said was Russia's vastly modernized nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world.",
            "\"Strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness,\" he said, noting that new-generation hypersonic nuclear weapons he first spoke about in 2018 had either been deployed or were at a stage where development and testing were being completed.",
            "Visibly angry, Putin suggested Western politicians recall the fate of those like Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler and France's Napoleon Bonaparte who had unsuccessfully invaded Russia in the past.",
            "\"But now the consequences will be far more tragic,\" said Putin. \"They think [war] is a cartoon,\" he said, accusing Western politicians of forgetting what real war meant because they had not faced the same security challenges as Russians had in the last three decades.",
            "Russian forces now had the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine and were advancing in several places, Putin said. Russia must also boost the troops it has deployed along its western borders with the European Union after Finland and Sweden decided to join the NATO military alliance, he added.",
            "The veteran Kremlin leader dismissed Western suggestions that Russian forces might go beyond Ukraine and attack European countries as \"nonsense.\" He also said Moscow would not repeat the mistake of the Soviet Union and allow the West to \"drag\" it into an arms race that would eat up too much of its budget.",
            "\"Therefore, our task is to develop the defense-industrial complex in such a way as to increase the scientific, technological, and industrial potential of the country,\" he said.",
            "Putin said Moscow was open to discussions on nuclear strategic stability with the United States but suggested that Washington had no genuine interest in such talks and was more focused on making false claims about Moscow's alleged aims.",
            "\"Recently there have been more and more unsubstantiated accusations against Russia, for example that we are allegedly going to deploy nuclear weapons in space. Such innuendo ... is a ploy to draw us into negotiations on their terms, which are favorable only to the United States,\" he said.",
