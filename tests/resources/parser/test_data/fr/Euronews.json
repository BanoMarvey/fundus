            "This decision follows recent revelations that a significant proportion—up to 80%—of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland have entered through the land border with Northern Ireland.",
            "Emphasising the importance of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of Ireland's migration system, a spokesperson for Harris stated that the proposed emergency measures are part of a broader effort to strengthen the system, ensuring that rules are applied firmly and fairly.",
