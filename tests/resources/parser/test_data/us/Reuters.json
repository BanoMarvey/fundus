            "The airline\r\n had said a flight carrying 167 passengers from the Nepali capital \r\nKathmandu to Dubai experienced a bird strike during take-off late on \r\nMonday.",
            "The\r\n plane continued on its journey after determining that the engine was \r\nwithin normal operation parameters, a spokesperson for flydubai said, \r\nand the aircraft landed normally in Dubai just after midnight local \r\ntime.",
            "But\r\n the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) said on Twitter on Tuesday\r\n that the airline's country manager and airport manager had been barred \r\nfrom entering Kathmandu airport for spreading \"misleading\" news about a \r\nbird strike.",
            "Flydubai\r\n said it would respond shortly to a request for comment on the tweet. \r\nThe UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority did not immediately respond \r\nto a request for comment.",
            "\"How\r\n did the company say it was a case of bird strike. The pilot has not \r\nreported that and there is no evidence of it so far. There is no proof \r\nor basis for this,\" Jagannath Niroula, a CAAN spokesperson, said.",
            "Niroula\r\n said that one of the plane's engines had caught fire shortly after \r\ntake-off from Kathmandu, and the CAAN had set up a technical committee \r\nto investigate.",
            "Mountainous Nepal has a history of deadly air crashes\r\n and suffered its worst plane crash in 30 years in January this year, \r\nkilling all 72 people aboard an ATR 72 aircraft operated by Yeti \r\nAirlines."
