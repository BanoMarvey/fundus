            "The Chase host Bradley Walsh reacted in fear during Monday's show (April 22) after a contestant detailed her surprise hobby. After fellow hopefuls Jennifer and Martin had taken on Anne 'The Governess' Hegerty, third player Megan was introduced. She revealed she was a 20-year old Nottingham University student, studying German and Politics. It was what Megan does in her spare time that caused a stir, however. \"So I'm the captain of the university judo team,\" Megan explained. \"I've been doing judo for just under a decade now.\" READ MORE: The Chase's Jenny Ryan drops bombshell as Bradley Walsh accused of 'flirting' with player READ MORE: The Chase's Jenny Ryan floored by Joel Dommett's 'bravery' after making ITV history \"Wow are you good?\" asked Brad, intrigued. \"I bet you're good.\" Megan responded: \"I'm a black belt.

Megan replied: \"It's a shoulder throw. So basically you throw them over your shoulder.\" \"From behind?\" he asked, nervously. \"Yeah,\" said Megan. \"You grab them and throw them.\" Megan's hobby caught Bradley by surprise (Image: ITV) \"I'll watch out for that,\" said Bradley, prompting the studio to break out into laughter. Back to the game, Megan struggled in her cash builder round, answering just one question to earn a potential for £1,000 for the team's prize pot. She had another surprise in store meanwhile, after Anne offered her safe £500 and a risky £40,000 to play for. Megan opted for the £500, thus beginning three steps ahead of The Governess and safely making it home. Megan proved no match for The Governess (Image: ITV) Over on X (formerly Twitter) viewers reacted in disbelief, with one commenting: \"So Megan, you're laughing at Anne for getting questions wrong, when you got just £1k on the cash builder, and then took the low offer...? #thechase #Shame.\" Another joked: \"Megan, being a remedial student, takes the low offer.\" A third cursed: \"Could have gone high and took a £500 low offer #thechase.\" And a fourth said: \"Taking the low offer is a no brainer and quite appropriate.\" For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters here."
